By most accounts, the first firewall was invented a year later, circa 1992, to the credit of multiple inventors.

Cadre was formed from a team of software developers that began to branch out into data security very quickly. In delving deeper, they recognized the risk potential for companies, a threat that many organizations had yet to understand entirely. Their early discussions began by explaining what a firewall does and more often backtracked to how a network functions behind the desktop.

By most accounts, the first firewall was invented a year later, circa 1992, to the credit of multiple inventors. In the world of security technology, over two decades of experience makes Cadre a true pioneer in the business. Cadre was formed from a team of software developers that began to branch out into data security very quickly. In delving deeper, they recognized the risk potential for companies, a threat that many organizations had yet to understand entirely. Their early discussions began by explaining what a firewall does and more often backtracked to how a network functions behind the desktop. Inspired by the opportunity to stand at the forefront of a breakthrough in the technology industry, Cadre entered the security arena in 1996.", "website": "https://www.cadre.net/", "name": null}, {"level": "silver", "logo": "https://futureconevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Gigamon.png", "description": "We’re changing how you see and control your entire network traffic with the industry’s only network visibility fabric designed for the digital enterprise.", "website": "https://www.gigamon.com/", "name": null}, {"level": "silver", "logo": "https://futureconevents.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/InNet.png", "description": "InNet partners with customers to design, deploy, and support a full suite of advanced technology solutions focusing upon enterprise and mid-market IT organizations and assisting in regards to networks, information security, business continuity, storage, cloud migration, virtualization and performance monitoring.
