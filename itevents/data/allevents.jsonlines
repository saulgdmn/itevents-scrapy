It exists firmly at the intersection of health equity and public policy.\nIn addition to powerful workshops, there will be informative Lunch & Learn events, a Body+ Pool Party, book signings, a networking mixer and a Womxn's March! \nIn 2020 we are Exploring the Future of Reproductive Justice. The 3 tracks of focus are:\n1. Birth Justice  Birth justice is part of a wider movement against reproductive oppression. It exists when people that give birth are empowered during pregnancy, labor, childbirth and postpartum to make healthy decisions for themselves and their babies.\n2. HIV & Reproductive Justice  People that give birth and are living with HIV can have more complex reproductive health support needs. The increasing incidence of undetectable status among those living with HIV is a victory that presents new opportunities for birth, reproductive, and sexual health disparities.\n3. Whos Got Next?  We are blessed enough to have some of the original disruptors of the RJ movement still walking among us, but who will take on the mantle? Young leaders are integral to maintaining progress in any movement and this track aims to explore who those young leaders are, how to engage and support them, and what issues are important to them (including LGBT+ lenses, faith and RJ, and healthcare access).", "date": "2020-10-15T00:00:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": [], "address": " Paid Registrants Only, TBA, Dallas, United States ", "city": "Dallas", "region": "Texas", "country": "United States of America", "latitude": "32.776271449999996", "longitude": "-96.79694174895133"}

Do what you Relish with whom you Relish. \n-\nSpeed Dating @ Green Door Public House - October 20th 2020\nAges: 25-39 | 8PM\n600 S Harwood St, Dallas, TX 75201\nFor more information visit us at: DoRelish.com\nOr email us at: \naW5mbyB8IGRvcmVsaXNoICEgY29t\n \nhttp://www.dorelish.com\nWe think the best relationships are forged when we are comfortable, relaxed and free of pressure. Preferring instead to think of the evening as a casual night out where one can truly be themselves. We do not use traditional 'speed dating' offerings such as bells, whistles and name-tags. Instead we focus on creating an atmosphere conducive to meeting others; a great venue, a personable host and a staff to assist.\nUpon arriving at your chosen event - locate your event host. Your host will assist in setting you up with your scorecard for the evening. A simple and convenient way to keep track of whom you enjoyed meeting and those that you would like to see again. Should you have any questions - feel free to ask away. Take the time before the event starts to settle in - have a beverage if you would like and mingle should you wish. The speed dating portion of the event begins once all daters have arrived, checked in and had a moment or two to relax and unwind.\nDuring the event, Ladies will stay seated and the Gentleman will rotate from table to table every 5 - 6 minutes. Our host will guide the Gentleman to let them know when their time is up and facilitate in seeing them to the next table. The goal is to find someone you would like to speak with further. Don't fret about figuring out if person is the one or the perfect person for you. Consider it the date before the date. Select those you would like to meet again and give the completed scorecard back to your host at the end of the evening. Our staff will tabulate the results and email you the following day with your results. If you choose someone and they chose you - it's a match. You will be given each others first name and email address. The rest is up to you.\nRelish Dating is uniquely ushering in the new era of dating.

THIS WILL BE AN UPCLOSE & PERSONAL EXPERIENCE... \nTanya Stephens was one of the most promising female reggae artists to emerge in the late 90s. Stephens caught her big break in 1996, when her ladies anthem, Yuh Nuh Ready fi Dis Yet, caused quite a stir (later spotlighted on the Reggae Gold 1997 compilation), as she soon after began working with such acclaimed producers as Barry OHare, Bobby Digital Dixon, Harvel Gadaffi Hart, and Dave and Tony Kelly. Future singles followed, including Draw fi Mi Finger, Freaky Type, and Cry and Bawl, as well as the full-length releases Too Hype in 1997 and Ruff Rider a year later (Stephens also contributed backing vocals on Garnett Silks 1998 release Journey). She then moved to Sweden and began recording a series of alternative rock tracks. Unhappy with her new direction, she returned to reggae in 2004 with Gangsta Blues and its big hit single Boom Wuk. The ambitious Rebelution appeared in 2006 with female empowerment as its focus. She dropped \"guilty\" in 2014 and is back with a brand new track labled \"TOP SHELF\"! #heroeslounge #tanyastephens #dallasreggae #dallasdub #dallasnightlife #fridaynight #freeupfridays @ Heroes Lounge", "date": "2020-11-06T00:00:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": [], "address": " HEROES LOUNGE, 3094 N.

Michael Hurd", "summary": " \n An Evening With! Michael Hurd -\nAbout this Event\nThursday Night Lights tells the inspiring, largely unknown story of African American high school football in Texas. Drawing on interviews, newspaper stories, and memorabilia, Michael Hurd introduces the players, coaches, schools, and towns where African Americans built powerhouse football programs under the PVIL leadership. He covers fifty years (1920-1970) of high school football history, including championship seasons and legendary rivalries such as the annual Turkey Day Classic game between Houston schools Jack Yates and Phillis Wheatley, which drew standing-room-only crowds of up to 40,000, making it the largest prep sports event in postwar America. In telling this story, Hurd explains why the PVIL was necessary, traces its development, and shows how football offered a potent source of pride and ambition in the black community, helping black kids succeed both athletically and educationally in a racist society.\nAbout the Author:\nMichael Hurd is the director of the Texas Institute for the Preservation of History and Culture at Prairie View A&M University. The Institute focuses on documenting the almost 500-year history of African American presence in Texas dating to 1528. Born in Texarkana, Texas, he grew up in Houston. He is an Air Force veteran who served eight years as a medic, including one year (1971) at Phu Cat Air Base, Vietnam, and was a recipient of the Air Force Commendation Medal. He is a graduate in Journalism from the University of Texas at Austin and has worked as a sports writer at the Houston Post, the Austin American-Statesman, USA Today  for 12 years as a member of the founding staff in 1982, and Yahoo Sports. His third and most recent book, \"Thursday Night Lights,\" was published by UT Press in 2017 and covers the history of football programs at black high schools in Texas before integration, 1920-1970. The book was named by the Texas Observer as one of the 30 best Texas books during the 2010-2019 decade. He is a trustee with the Friends of the Texas Historical Commission, a board member with the Writers League of Texas, and is also a member of the Texas Institute of Letters.

Do you accept hazmat shipments? Are your employees certified to ship hazmat? If your answer to any of the above is yes then you probably already know Compliance Solutions. If youre new to shipping hazmat or just found out you need hazmat training you need to get to know us! Compliance Solutions is the nations largest private provider of hazmat training. Since 1995 we have helped companies across North America comply with DOT hazmat shipping regulations (49 CFR 172.704) and saved them thousands of dollars in the process!\nAccording to the DOT (The U.S.Department of Transportation)\n any company involved in the transport of hazardous materials by air, rail, ground or water must provide Hazmat transportation certification within 90 days of an employee starting work. Our DOT Hazmat Complete training is a one-day seminar designed to certify your employees in transporting hazardous materials. DOT regulations state: Any person involved in offering a hazardous material for transportation must be properly trainedsic Upon completion you will be able to:\n Demonstrate the correct methods used for the shipping, handling and transporting of hazardous materials\n Identify the proper shipping methods for hazardous materials in air, water, and land.\n Recognize information needed on shipping papers for specific types of hazardous wastes\n Utilize proper labeling, marking, and placarding required for hazardous waste transportation\n Develop information gathering techniques needed for required incident reporting and emergency notification\n Show an understanding of the documentation for shipping papers and manifests.\nAfter your initial training, you need to refresh your certification every 3 years or when the regulations \"substantially change\". This course qualifies as the initial training or refresher training. Be advised that should your certification lapse, you may not take part in any hazardous materials shipping functions unsupervised until your certification has been renewed. New employees may perform hazardous materials shipping functions for the first 90-days provided they have direct supervision. After this time they must be certified.\nCompliance Solutions\n DOT Hazmat Certification Course uses a unique \"10-step approach\" for shipping and handling hazardous materials properly. Each element is covered in detail through use of \"real-world\" examples of what to do and what NOT to do when shipping hazardous materials.\nDOT\n regulations require all students to pass a certification exam which is given at the end of the course. A Certificate of Completion signed by the Instructor and Compliance Solutions, along with a personalized wallet card will be issued upon successfully passing the exam and completing the course requirements.\nIndustries using DOT Transportation certification include but are not limited to:\n Trucking Companies\n CDL Drivers\n Package Delivery Companies\n Medical Supply Delivery Companies\n Home Medical Supply Companies\n Chemical Manufacturing or Shipping\n Environmental firms that package and ship hazardous waste\n Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facilities\n Warehouse Personnel\nPlease be advised:\n Extensive Student participation and interaction during this class is REQUIRED. Students must complete hands-on exercises designed to prepare them for shipping of hazardous materials in the workplace. If you are not prepared to interact with other students and the instructor during class, we suggest you consider taking a web-based (online) DOT Hazmat Initial or Refresher training courses instead.\nRegistration Note:\n This event does NOT issue paper tickets. After registration you will receive an email confirmation from Compliance Solutions that includes the date, time and location of your class. Prior to registering read a copy of our cancellation and refund policy. Once registered, you acknowledge you have read and agree to be bound by our this policy.\nhttps://cdn-az.allevents.in/events5/banners/f569f4e0-0bff-11eb-8867-d576250b9a7f-rimg-w720-h720-gmir.jpg", "date": "2020-12-14T00:00:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": [], "address": " 10370 N Central Expy, 10370 N Central Expy, Dallas , United States ", "city": "Dallas", "region": "Texas", "country": "United States of America", "latitude": "32.9096366", "longitude": "-96.7688216"}

In its early days, Ministry was identifiable by its heavy synth-pop material in line with the new sounds and technology that were being developed in the 80s. Ministrys output began with four 12 singles on Wax Trax! Records in 1981 before the first LP With Sympathy in 1983 via Arista Records.As time progressed however, so did Ministry, quickly developing a harsher, and more stylized sound that the band soon became infamous for on seminal albums Twitch (1986), The Land of Rape and Honey (1988), and The Mind Is A Terrible Thing To Taste (1989). With the release of Psalm 69: The Way to Succeed and The Way to Suck Eggs (1992), Ministry hit an all time high in the mainstream musical realm and received its first Grammy nomination. In total, Ministry has been nominated for a Grammy award six times. After an indefinite hiatus in 2013, Ministrys latest album, 2018s AmeriKKKant, continues to reflect Jourgensens views on the frightening state of society and politics. With the latest lineup featuring Sin Quirin and Cesar Soto on guitars, John Bechdel (Killing Joke) on keys, London May (Samhain) on drums and Paul DAmour (Tool) on bass, Ministry continues touring and recording with new music and a few more surprises planned.\nKMFDM\nFrontline Assembly ", "date": "2021-04-24T00:00:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": [], "address": " Gas Monkey Bar N' Grill, 10261 Technology Blvd E, Dallas, United States ", "city": "Dallas", "region": "Texas", "country": "United States of America", "latitude": "32.86081634999999", "longitude": "-96.8960889440549"}

But over the course of 12 albums across more than 25 years\ntogether, theyve rarely set their sights on singular individuals in\nsongs. Unlike their punk predecessors in the 80s, who made targets of\nReagan and his cronies, Anti-Flag has always opted not to date their\nwork with current references, instead focusing on fighting ongoing\noppression and dismantling deeply rooted systems of injustice. But on\ntheir new album, 20/20 Vision, the band is drawing a big, fat line in\nthe sand.\nWe have actively chosen to not attack Presidents directly, either\nwith album art or songs about certain times in history, because we\nrecognize that the issues were dealing with are cyclical, says\nbassist Chris #2. But this record in particular, we kind of said,\nwell fuck that, we need to be on the record in opposition to the\npolicies of Donald Trump and Mike Pence.\nThis record is a warning to people holding neofascist ideas or people\nwho are enabling these types of positions, whether youre outright\nracist or youre enabling racism or sexism or homophobia or\ntransphobia, adds guitarist Justin Sane. You need to make a choice\nat this point. What weve seen with this White House is that theres\nno grey area anymore.\nProduced by From First to Lasts Matt Good, 20/20 Vision (Spinefarm\nRecords, January 17, 2020) kicks off with a soundbite of Donald Trump\nspeaking at a rally. And while just about anything the man has said\nover the last few years would make for a fitting sample on a punk\nrecord, Anti-Flag were deliberate in their choice. In the good old\ndays, this doesnt happen, because they used to treat them very, very\nrough, Trump is heard saying over the opening track, Hate Conquers\nAll. And when they protested once, they would not do it again so\neasily.\nWhat I found compelling about that particular Trump sample is that\nits the quintessential move that he pulls, which is: Say the thing\ninto the world early, so that when it happens later, people are\nalready accustomed to it, says #2, who believes that dissenters like\njournalists, protestors, and punk bands are not far down on the list\nof those who will eventually be rounded up and detained. Weve always\ncautioned that if youre not standing up for the most marginalized and\nthe most oppressed then youre not truly free.\nHate Conquers All seeks to dissect the lexicon we use around racism\nto hold ourselves more accountable. The song is a kneejerk reaction\nto the idea of Love Trumps Hate and this idea that love can beat back\nhatred, notes #2. That equates racism with hatred. Thats a false\nequivalence of what the language should be. If youre racist, youre\nracist. You dont just hate people. It should be considered a much\nmore vile term.\nLater on the album, Christian Nationalist calls out those hiding\nbehind religious zealotry to mask their neofacism, and the chorus\nmakes it clear that these people will be held accountable: We all\nknow who you are!\nWhen you listen to David Duke talk, youre listening to Donald Trump\ntalk, Sane says of the track. These people hide behind the veneer of\nsuits or speaking well and the various ways in which they hide their\nbigotry, but the reality is that theyre just as bad as the fascists\nin the 1930s or the segregationists in America.\nIm not saying doxxing is OK, but I think it is important to let a\ncommunity know that their neighbor is a racist who was chanting, Jews\nwill not replace us! There has to be accountability.\nOn 20/20 Visions title track, the band takes a deliberately poppy\napproach to grappling with a tough pill theyve had to swallow\nrecently: Seeing elements of the framework that punk bands like\nAnti-Flag have established over the last couple of decades as it is\ncoopted and used as talking points by the alt-right.\nThe roadmap that we created in the 90s, of alternative media and\nforms of communicating, was a left-wing strategy to bring truth to\npower, says drummer Pat Thetic. The right wing has very effectively\ntaken all those skills we learned in the 80s and 90s and turned them\nagainst the left. Thats been a challenging thing for us, to see the\nstrategies that we grew up with being used against us in such an\neffective way.\nAnd while the newscycle moves faster than ever before, 20/20 Vision\naims to take a step back and stare down the most pressing problems of\nour time: kids in cages, the fentanyl crisis, rolling back EPA\nrestrictions. Its a record that at once feels both timely and forward\nthinking. 20/20 Vision is a work that Anti-Flag hopes will serve as an\nimmediate form of communication with those who are politically engaged\nas well as a document of our modern times for a future generation.\nAs #2 puts it: We hope that when someone trips over this record in\nthe sand of the post apocalypse, theyll know that there were people\nwho once stood in opposition to all of this.\nhttps://cdn-az.allevents.in/events2/banners/ceb5d2d0-d741-11ea-b161-c52aff846b3b-rimg-w720-h360-gmir.jpg", "date": "2021-05-18T00:00:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": [], "address": " Club Dada, 2720 Elm Street, Dallas, United States ", "city": "Dallas", "region": "Texas", "country": "United States of America", "latitude": "32.7844286", "longitude": "-96.78399909841976"}

Mark left and the 17 year old Michael Gilbert joined the band in 1985. Flotsam and Jetsam released two demo tapes in 1985, Iron Tears and Metal Shock. We created our own video \"Hammerhead\" from the Metal Shock demo in Jason's living room. We also recorded live video from the infamous club Bootleggers. Those combined with the demos made a good impression on Record labels and after we contributed to the Speed Metal Hell II and Metal Massacre VII compilations, we got a deal with Metal Blade Records.\nThen we recorded our first album in Los Angeles with producer Brian Slagel. The release of \"Doomsday for the Deceiver\" was on July 19, 1986. Many considered this album as a milestone in the history of thrash metal and we were the first band in KERRANG's history to achieve the 6K rating. Bassist Jason Newsted, who was also the band's main lyric writer, departed soon after to join Metallica, replacing their bassist Cliff Burton who died in an accident. Flotsam and Jetsam had asked another local bassist Phil Rind, \"Sacred Reich\", to fill in Jason's place for a short time. We then acquired Mike Spencer from Sacramento band \"Sentinel Beast\". The band signed with Elektra Records before touring Europe with Megadeth in 1987.", "date": "2021-05-08T00:00:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": [], "address": " Trees, 2709 Elm Street, Dallas, United States ", "city": "Dallas", "region": "Texas", "country": "United States of America", "latitude": "32.7847016", "longitude": "-96.78447095011215"}

More details to follow but RSVP to receive special early purchase ticket prices .\nWine Crawl is private wine tour in select cities that includes trips to popular wine bars, wineries and restaurants.

This is a chance to accomplish that, and raise funds for the trails at the same time. Not to mention being part of the DDR first ever Poker Run.The rules are simple, run a trail, get a card. Best hand wins. Now, we're trail runners, so we really can't have things that simple. If you run the bonus miles at Big Cedar, OCNP and Boulder you get to discard and draw two cards.Also, we are going with \"standard\" poker run rules, when you draw your card at a trailhead, if you already have that same card you will discard and draw a new card (No, you can't have a pair of Ace of Spades). You don't need 5 cards to win, if you've pulled 4 aces you're going to be hard to beat. Of course, if there is a tie (which is possible, even with 4 aces) the winner will be determined by cutting the cards, low card wins)The mileage is approximate, the trails won't be marked, and it's all on the honor system (wait, honor at a poker game!). If the trails are closed due to weather, the event will not happen. If only one trail is closed, we will run at CRP as a replacement.All finishers must be done running and at Boulder by 8PM for the prize giveaway.

This beloved American holiday classic comes to captivating life as a live 1940s radio broadcast. With the help of an ensemble of 5 that brings a few dozen characters to the stage, the story of idealistic George Bailey unfolds one fateful Christmas Eve. This inventive twist on Frank Capras classic film brings the ever-timely story of disaster, redemption, and holiday magic to life on stage before your eyes and ears. Its Christmas Eve, 1946, and five actors have gathered in Studio A for a live radio broadcast, ready to take on dozens of characters and recreate Bedford Falls with live foley sound effects and virtuosic, high-energy performances.

Medical, social, political, and environmental threats loom large. The world seems doomed. The end is nigh. Hope slinks away.\nToo often, the church has added to the hysteria of hopelessness by preaching an anemic gospel that leaves earth in the devil's hands.\nIn this course, Peter J. Leithart, President of the Theopolis Institute, explores what the Bible teaches about our future and the world's.\nBy explaining how hope is rooted in the entire biblical story from creation through cross to consummation, this course provides a solid foundation for Christian hope.\nGod is our hope. We hope in the face of hopelessness because we worship a God who raises the dead and calls things that are not as though they were.\nHope drives mission as it inspires creativity, insight, and spirited action. This course will help the church meet the challenges of the present and the future with radical hope.\n-\nFriday, November 6\n8:30 AM: Matins\n9 AM  noon: Lecture & Discussion\nNoon: Sext\n12:15 PM  2 PM: Lunch\n2 PM  4:30 PM: Lecture & Discussion\n5 PM  7 PM: Dinner\n7 PM: Vespers\n7:30 PM: Evening Lectures\nSaturday, November 7\n8:30 AM: Matins\n9 AM  noon: Lecture & Discussion\nNoon: Sext\n12:15 PM  2 PM: Lunch\n2 PM  4:30 PM: Lecture & Discussion\n5 PM  7 PM: Dinner\n7 PM: Vespers\n7:30 PM: Evening Lectures", "date": "2020-11-06T00:00:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": [], "address": " The Chapel of the Cross, 4333 Cole Avenue, Dallas, United States ", "city": "Dallas", "region": "Texas", "country": "United States of America", "latitude": "32.8186976", "longitude": "-96.79181999993247"}

If you're tired of online dating, exhausted by meeting someone only to discover they're nothing like their profile - we offer an alternative. Bringing together comfortably chic venues with a cosmopolitan sensibility. A sophisticated no frills approach to singles events. We've done away with the whistles, name-tags and over the top party trimmings. Unparalleled service and personable hosts all in an environment - just your speed. A fresh alternative to typical events that seem more like a job fair than a relaxed way to connect. \nWhether it be a romantic dinner, wine tasting, concert or festival - bar crawl or fitness class - maybe even a Mud Run! Do what you Relish with whom you Relish. \n-\nSpeed Dating @ Green Door Public House - October 31st 2020\nAges: 24-38 | 6PM\n600 S Harwood St, Dallas, TX 75201\nFor more information visit us at: DoRelish.com\nOr email us at: \naW5mbyB8IGRvcmVsaXNoICEgY29t\n \nhttp://www.dorelish.com\nWe think the best relationships are forged when we are comfortable, relaxed and free of pressure. Preferring instead to think of the evening as a casual night out where one can truly be themselves. We do not use traditional 'speed dating' offerings such as bells, whistles and name-tags. Instead we focus on creating an atmosphere conducive to meeting others; a great venue, a personable host and a staff to assist.\nUpon arriving at your chosen event - locate your event host. Your host will assist in setting you up with your scorecard for the evening. A simple and convenient way to keep track of whom you enjoyed meeting and those that you would like to see again. Should you have any questions - feel free to ask away. Take the time before the event starts to settle in - have a beverage if you would like and mingle should you wish. The speed dating portion of the event begins once all daters have arrived, checked in and had a moment or two to relax and unwind.\nDuring the event, Ladies will stay seated and the Gentleman will rotate from table to table every 5 - 6 minutes. Our host will guide the Gentleman to let them know when their time is up and facilitate in seeing them to the next table. The goal is to find someone you would like to speak with further.

We've done away with the whistles, name-tags and over the top party trimmings. Unparalleled service and personable hosts all in an environment - just your speed. A fresh alternative to typical events that seem more like a job fair than a relaxed way to connect. \nWhether it be a romantic dinner, wine tasting, concert or festival - bar crawl or fitness class - maybe even a Mud Run!

Preferring instead to think of the evening as a casual night out where one can truly be themselves. We do not use traditional 'speed dating' offerings such as bells, whistles and name-tags. Instead we focus on creating an atmosphere conducive to meeting others; a great venue, a personable host and a staff to assist.\nUpon arriving at your chosen event - locate your event host. Your host will assist in setting you up with your scorecard for the evening. A simple and convenient way to keep track of whom you enjoyed meeting and those that you would like to see again. Should you have any questions - feel free to ask away. Take the time before the event starts to settle in - have a beverage if you would like and mingle should you wish. The speed dating portion of the event begins once all daters have arrived, checked in and had a moment or two to relax and unwind.\nDuring the event, Ladies will stay seated and the Gentleman will rotate from table to table every 5 - 6 minutes. Our host will guide the Gentleman to let them know when their time is up and facilitate in seeing them to the next table. The goal is to find someone you would like to speak with further. Don't fret about figuring out if person is the one or the perfect person for you. Consider it the date before the date. Select those you would like to meet again and give the completed scorecard back to your host at the end of the evening. Our staff will tabulate the results and email you the following day with your results. If you choose someone and they chose you - it's a match. You will be given each others first name and email address. The rest is up to you.\nRelish Dating is uniquely ushering in the new era of dating.

Preferring instead to think of the evening as a casual night out where one can truly be themselves. We do not use traditional 'speed dating' offerings such as bells, whistles and name-tags. Instead we focus on creating an atmosphere conducive to meeting others; a great venue, a personable host and a staff to assist.\nUpon arriving at your chosen event - locate your event host. Your host will assist in setting you up with your scorecard for the evening. A simple and convenient way to keep track of whom you enjoyed meeting and those that you would like to see again. Should you have any questions - feel free to ask away. Take the time before the event starts to settle in - have a beverage if you would like and mingle should you wish. The speed dating portion of the event begins once all daters have arrived, checked in and had a moment or two to relax and unwind.\nDuring the event, Ladies will stay seated and the Gentleman will rotate from table to table every 5 - 6 minutes. Our host will guide the Gentleman to let them know when their time is up and facilitate in seeing them to the next table. The goal is to find someone you would like to speak with further. Don't fret about figuring out if person is the one or the perfect person for you. Consider it the date before the date. Select those you would like to meet again and give the completed scorecard back to your host at the end of the evening. Our staff will tabulate the results and email you the following day with your results. If you choose someone and they chose you - it's a match. You will be given each others first name and email address. The rest is up to you.\nRelish Dating is uniquely ushering in the new era of dating.

Join us at our first-time home buying seminar and master class. Come and learn about our Real Estate Investing education service and how people are changing lives in our community by building long term security through investing in Real Estate!\nAre you ready to be financially secure?\nLearn how to invest in Real Estate, receive residual income and become financially independent. Please understand this is not a get rich quick, pie in the sky, or win the lottery operation! We offer a proven method that has helped people improve their financial situation when they learn how to invest and put that knowledge into action.\nReal Estate Investing is not easy; it requires study and application of techniques you have learned. Banks have different requirements, laws change, and profit margins disappear when you don't have the latest information. Knowledge is critical, money is important, and networking with the right people is necessary. We provide the information and join hands with a community of investors to show how it is done.\nWe work as a team, applaud each other success, sometimes collaborate on projects and learn how to structure the deal for more profit. We create successful Real Estate Investors and we can show success while learning the system.\nOne of those techniques help you to become DEBT Free by paying off your mortgage debt, student loans, car loan and other amortized debt in about one third the time without changing your lifestyle. If that sounds too good to be true, come and see how its done and learn to do it yourself.\nIf you have been looking for a way to get into short term rentals (Airbnb), flipping houses, buy and hold, lease options, short sales, subject-to, wholesaling or another method of investing in real estate and you are looking to network, and collaborate with other real estate investors while getting valuable knowledge and experience, then attend this seminar presentation.\nAll are welcome to attend!\nRegister now!\nTickets include Admission, Gourmet Dinner & Tour of Property\nDoors open at 5:30pm, Home Tour and dinner served for the first hour.

If you're tired of online dating, exhausted by meeting someone only to discover they're nothing like their profile - we offer an alternative. Bringing together comfortably chic venues with a cosmopolitan sensibility. A sophisticated no frills approach to singles events. We've done away with the whistles, name-tags and over the top party trimmings. Unparalleled service and personable hosts all in an environment - just your speed. A fresh alternative to typical events that seem more like a job fair than a relaxed way to connect. \nWhether it be a romantic dinner, wine tasting, concert or festival - bar crawl or fitness class - maybe even a Mud Run! Do what you Relish with whom you Relish. \n-\nSpeed Dating @ Longhorn Icehouse - October 17th 2020\nAges: 26-38 | 6PM\n1901 W Northwest Hwy, Dallas, TX 75220\nFor more information visit us at: DoRelish.com\nOr email us at: \naW5mbyB8IGRvcmVsaXNoICEgY29t\n \nhttp://www.dorelish.com\nWe think the best relationships are forged when we are comfortable, relaxed and free of pressure. Preferring instead to think of the evening as a casual night out where one can truly be themselves. We do not use traditional 'speed dating' offerings such as bells, whistles and name-tags. Instead we focus on creating an atmosphere conducive to meeting others; a great venue, a personable host and a staff to assist.\nUpon arriving at your chosen event - locate your event host. Your host will assist in setting you up with your scorecard for the evening. A simple and convenient way to keep track of whom you enjoyed meeting and those that you would like to see again. Should you have any questions - feel free to ask away. Take the time before the event starts to settle in - have a beverage if you would like and mingle should you wish. The speed dating portion of the event begins once all daters have arrived, checked in and had a moment or two to relax and unwind.\nDuring the event, Ladies will stay seated and the Gentleman will rotate from table to table every 5 - 6 minutes. Our host will guide the Gentleman to let them know when their time is up and facilitate in seeing them to the next table. The goal is to find someone you would like to speak with further. Don't fret about figuring out if person is the one or the perfect person for you. Consider it the date before the date. Select those you would like to meet again and give the completed scorecard back to your host at the end of the evening. Our staff will tabulate the results and email you the following day with your results. If you choose someone and they chose you - it's a match. You will be given each others first name and email address. The rest is up to you.\nRelish Dating is uniquely ushering in the new era of dating.

Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort's defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information. Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane's chocolates! And then there's Hermione, simmering with jealously but determined not to show her feelings. As romance blossoms, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.

If you're tired of online dating, exhausted by meeting someone only to discover they're nothing like their profile - we offer an alternative. Bringing together comfortably chic venues with a cosmopolitan sensibility. A sophisticated no frills approach to singles events. We've done away with the whistles, name-tags and over the top party trimmings. Unparalleled service and personable hosts all in an environment - just your speed. A fresh alternative to typical events that seem more like a job fair than a relaxed way to connect. \nWhether it be a romantic dinner, wine tasting, concert or festival - bar crawl or fitness class - maybe even a Mud Run! Do what you Relish with whom you Relish. \n-\nSpeed Dating @ Harwood Tavern Restaurant - October 15th 2020\nAges: 25-39 | 8PM\n333 S Harwood St, Dallas, TX 75201\nFor more information visit us at: DoRelish.com\nOr email us at: \naW5mbyB8IGRvcmVsaXNoICEgY29t\n \nhttp://www.dorelish.com\nWe think the best relationships are forged when we are comfortable, relaxed and free of pressure. Preferring instead to think of the evening as a casual night out where one can truly be themselves. We do not use traditional 'speed dating' offerings such as bells, whistles and name-tags. Instead we focus on creating an atmosphere conducive to meeting others; a great venue, a personable host and a staff to assist.\nUpon arriving at your chosen event - locate your event host. Your host will assist in setting you up with your scorecard for the evening. A simple and convenient way to keep track of whom you enjoyed meeting and those that you would like to see again. Should you have any questions - feel free to ask away. Take the time before the event starts to settle in - have a beverage if you would like and mingle should you wish. The speed dating portion of the event begins once all daters have arrived, checked in and had a moment or two to relax and unwind.\nDuring the event, Ladies will stay seated and the Gentleman will rotate from table to table every 5 - 6 minutes. Our host will guide the Gentleman to let them know when their time is up and facilitate in seeing them to the next table. The goal is to find someone you would like to speak with further. Don't fret about figuring out if person is the one or the perfect person for you. Consider it the date before the date. Select those you would like to meet again and give the completed scorecard back to your host at the end of the evening. Our staff will tabulate the results and email you the following day with your results. If you choose someone and they chose you - it's a match. You will be given each others first name and email address. The rest is up to you.\nRelish Dating is uniquely ushering in the new era of dating. As all guests are registered within a private network, Relish Dating is positioned to responsibly resume in-person meetups while assisting in the CDCs Contact Tracing recommendation by alerting all guests in attendance should a guest of Relish Dating report a positive COVID-19 result. Relish Dating is able to identify who was in attendance at the event and get in contact with them to maximize safety and stop the spread of COVID-19.\nOur highest priority is to maintain the safety and well being of our daters and hosts. To help protect all attendees, we have introduced a brief but beneficial pre-screening questionnaire and implemented a wide range of safety precautions.
