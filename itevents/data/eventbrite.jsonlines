Youll benefit from insights into how Paul varied his search technique and interpreted documents to overcome major barriers to tracing his great-grandfather. Join us and find out about how to trace your ancestry, incurring little or no cost.\n \n This talk will cover records specific to African Caribbean research, as well as other materials of more general interest to children of the Windrush Generation. When researching his own ancestry, Paul discovered his great-great-great grandfather had walked free from a sugar plantation in Jamaica in 1838. About the speaker: is unique as a published author and genealogist with a specialist interest in Black ancestry. Paul came to prominence with his pioneering research into African Caribbean genealogy in the 1990s, when he became the first to trace his family history back 6 generations and discovered his ancestors, who were enslaved on a sugar plantation in Jamaica 200 years ago. Paul gained national recognition for his work when his acclaimed historical novel, (based on the true story of the author's African ancestors), was published by Arcadia Books in 2002. He appeared on with Moira Stuart as the expert in African Caribbean genealogy and has been recognised for inspiring an upsurge in interest in Black and British ancestry.

About La Marks Founder of Ars Poetica, an international language arts agency specializing in interactive poetry. Poetry Therapy purple inkblots on collage of handwritten pagesPoetry therapy, a form of expressive arts therapy, involves the therapeutic use of poems, narratives, and other spoken or written media to promote well-being and healing. Therapists may use existing literature as part of treatment or encourage those in therapy to produce their own literary works to express deep-seated emotions. In either case, they offer a safe, non-judgmental atmosphere in which people in therapy are able to explore their written expressions and associated emotional responses. Though any mental health professional might incorporate elements of poetry therapy into their therapeutic practice, the International Federation for Biblio/Poetry Therapy has developed a credentialing program for those individuals who wish to become certified or registered poetry therapists. HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF POETRY THERAPY The healing effect of words has long been recognized. As far back as 4000 BCE, early Egyptians wrote words on papyrus, dissolve them in liquid, and gave them to those who were ill as a form of medicine. In more recent history, reading and expressive writing were employed as supplementary treatments for those experiencing mental or emotional distress. Pennsylvania Hospital, the first hospital established in the United States, reportedly employed this approach as early as the mid-1700s. In the early 1800s, Dr. Benjamin Rush introduced poetry as a form of therapy to those being treated. In 1928, poet and pharmacist Eli Griefer began offering poems to people filling prescriptions and eventually started \"poemtherapy\" groups at two different hospitals with the support of psychiatrists Dr. Jack L. Leedy and Dr. Sam Spector. After Griefer's death, Leedy and others continued to incorporate poetry into the therapeutic group process, eventually coming together to form the Association for Poetry Therapy (APT) in 1969. Librarians also played a major role in the development of this approach to therapy. Arleen Hynes, one pioneer in this area, was a hospital librarian who read about poetry therapy and began reading stories and poems aloud, facilitating discussions on the material and its relevance to each individual in order to better reach out to those being treated and encourage healing. She eventually began development of a training program for poetry therapy, around the time other individuals were doing the same. In 1980, all leaders in the field were invited to a meeting to formalize guidelines for training and certification. At that meeting, the National Association for Poetry Therapy (NAPT) formed out of what had been the APT. As interest grew, several books and articles were written to guide practitioners in the practice of poetry therapy. Hynes and Mary Hynes-Berry co-authored the 1986 publication Bibliotherapy - The Interactive Process: A Handbook. More recently, Nicholas Mazza outlined a model for effective poetry therapy, also discussing its clinical application, in Poetry Therapy: Theory and Practice. The Journal of Poetry Therapy, established in 1987 by the NAPT, remains the most comprehensive source of information on current theory, practice, and research.This page contains at least one affiliate link for the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, which means GoodTherapy.org receives financial compensation if you make a purchase using an Amazon link. Today, poetry therapy is practiced internationally by hundreds of professionals, including psychologists, psychiatrists, counselors, social workers, educators and librarians. The approach has been used successfully in a number of settingsschools, libraries, hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and correctional institutions, to name a fewwith various populations, including children, adolescents and the elderly. HOW DOES POETRY THERAPY WORK? As part of therapy, some people may wish to explore feelings and memories buried in the subconscious and identify how they may relate to current life circumstances. Poetry is believed to be beneficial to this process as it can often: Be used as a vehicle for the expression of emotions that might otherwise be difficult to express Promote self-reflection and exploration, increasing self-awareness and helping individuals make sense of their world Help individuals redefine their situation by opening up new ways of perceiving reality Validate emotional experiences and improve group cohesiveness by helping people realize many of their experiences are shared by others Help therapists gain deeper insight into those they are treating In general, poetry therapists are free to choose from any poems they believe offer therapeutic value, but most tend to follow general guidelines. It is recommended selected poems be concise, address universal emotions or experiences, offer some degree of hope, and contain plain language. Some poems commonly used in therapy are: \"The Road Not Taken\" by Robert Frost \"The Journey\" by Mary Oliver \"Talking to Grief\" by Denise Levertov \"The Armful\" by Robert Frost \"I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud\" by William Wordsworth Although the selection of material is usually done by the therapist, those being treated might be asked to bring to therapy a poem or other form of literature they identify with, as this may also provide valuable insight into their feelings and emotions. TECHNIQUES USED IN POETRY THERAPY A few different models of poetry therapy exist, but the most popular and most frequently used is the model introduced by Nicholas Mazza. According to this model, poetry therapy involves three major components: receptive/prescriptive, expressive/creative, and symbolic/ceremonial. In the receptive/prescriptive component, the therapist will introduce a poem or piece of literature and encourage the person in therapy to react. Material is typically selected based on its ability to describe, explain and identify issues relevant to the content of the session. Selected material is usually read aloud by the therapist or the person in therapy so the tone and rhythm of the poem can be fully experienced. In the case of group, family, or couples therapy, individuals may take turns reading different stanzas or might be asked to read the entire poem in unison. While the poem is being read, the therapist notes the verbal and nonverbal reactions of the individual, and these reactions are generally explored after the reading with questions such as, \"I noticed you were smiling as the poem was being read. Can you tell me about your reaction?\" \"Is there a particular line in the poem that touched you?\" \"How does this poem make you feel?\" The expressive/creative component involves the use of creative writingpoetry, letters, and journal entries--for the purpose of assessment and treatment. The process of writing can be both cathartic and empowering, often freeing blocked emotions or buried memories and giving voice to one's concerns and strengths. Some people may doubt their ability to write creatively, but therapists can offer supporting by explaining they do not have to use rhyme or a particular structure. Therapists might also provide stem poems from which to work or introduce sense poems for those who struggle with imagery. A therapist might also share a poem with the individual and then ask them to select a line that touched them in some way and then use that line to start their own poem. In group therapy, poems may be written individually or collaboratively. Group members are sometimes given a single word, topic, or sentence stem and asked to respond to it spontaneously. The contributions of group members are compiled to create a single poem which can then be used to stimulate group discussion. In couples therapy, the couple may be asked to write a dyadic poem by contributing alternating lines. Letter writing, another effective therapeutic tool, may be a more accessible creative platform for some. One exercise involves writing a letter to the persona of a poem read in therapy. The letter may include expressions of approval or disapproval, and this process can clarify the individual's initial reactions to the poem. A letter could also be addressed to any emotions presently causing difficulty in order to help a person visualize and externalize these feelings in the hope of gaining control over them. Individuals might also be encouraged to keep a personal journal during therapy and record their thoughts after hearing or reading a poem. Those in group therapy may have the opportunity to share their entries with group members. The symbolic/ceremonial component involves the use of metaphors, storytelling, and rituals as tools for effecting change. Metaphors, which are essentially symbols, can help individuals to explain complex emotions and experiences in a concise yet profound manner. Rituals may be particularly effective to help those who have experienced a loss or ending, such as a divorce or death of a loved one, to address their feelings around that event. Writing and then burning a letter to someone who died suddenly, for example, may be a helpful step in the process of accepting and coping with grief. HOW CAN POETRY THERAPY HELP? Poetry therapy has been used as part of the treatment approach for a number of concerns, including borderline personality, suicidal ideation, identity issues, perfectionism, and grief. Research shows the method is frequently a beneficial part of the treatment process. Several studies also support poetry therapy as one approach to the treatment of depression, as it has been repeatedly shown to relieve depressive symptoms, improve self-esteem and self-understanding, and encourage the expression of feelings. Researchers have also demonstrated poetry therapy's ability to reduce anxiety and distress in people diagnosed with a terminal illness. Those experiencing posttraumatic stress have also reported improved mental and emotional well-being as a result of poetry therapy. Some individuals who have survived trauma or abuse may have difficulty processing the experience cognitively and, as a result, suppress associated memories and emotions. Through poetry therapy, many are able to integrate these feelings, reframe traumatic events, and develop a more positive outlook for the future. People experiencing addiction may find poetry therapy can help them explore their feelings regarding the substance abuse, perceive drug use in a new light, and develop or strengthen coping skills. Poetry writing may also be a way for those with substance abuse issues to express their thoughts on treatment and behavior change. Some studies have shown poetry therapy can be of benefit to people with schizophrenia despite the linguistic and emotional deficits associated with the condition. Poetry writing may be a helpful method of describe mental experiences and can allow therapists to better understand the thought processes of those they are treating. Poetry therapy has also helped some individuals with schizophrenia to improve social functioning skills and foster more organized thought processes. It is important to note in most instances, especially in cases of moderate to severe mental health concerns, poetry therapy is used in combination with another type of therapy, not as the sole approach to treatment. #poetry #love #poetrycommunity #writersofinstagram #poem #poet #quotes #poetsofinstagram #writer #poems #writing #art #lovequotes #shayari #thoughts #wordporn #quoteoftheday #instagram #quote #life #writersofig #writerscommunity #poetrylovers #urdupoetry #poetryofinstagram #words #writingcommunity #follow #inspirationalquote #societyx #arspoetica #poets", "date": "2020-10-21T14:00:00-04:00", "virtual": true, "live": false, "tags": ["online_events", "online_classes", "online_arts_classes", "#workshop", "#poetry", "#writers", "#writing", "#creative_writing", "#online_events", "#poet", "#online_education", "#online_classes", "#poetry_therapy"], "address": null, "city": null, "region": null, "country": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}

This workshop will provide for its attendees new routes for teaching and learning about race-equality through the concept of critical multicultural education and theories of historical consciousness for de-colonising the curriculum. This workshop will begin with sharing some understandings of de-colonisation. We will discuss what we think this term implies for ourselves as educators: How are we orientated? How does this positioning have an influence on the work of our schools, and the learning of our children? The concept of critical multicultural education and theories of historical consciousness are shared as routes to praxis for de-colonising the curriculum. The desired outcome of this workshop is to empower school leaders and teachers to see how they are able to enact the current aims and contents of the national curriculum through their trans-formative and inclusive interpretations of praxis. Dr Marlon Moncrieffe offers expertise in teaching and learning through theories of critical multicultural education. He taught in Primary Schools from 1999 to 2013 and was a Head of Mathematics, Head of English and Deputy-Headteacher leading on curriculum, monitoring, and assessment. His continuing research on curriculum development advances Initial Teacher Training and Primary School education through the use of narrative inquiry as a method for teaching and learning on Race Equality. He focuses particularly on the application of 20th century Black-British history and its cross-cultural interaction with White-Britain for helping to advance education, teaching and learning about fundamental British Values (civic national values) and for 'Decolonising the Curriculum'. He takes an interdisciplinary approach to research through education, history, sociology, arts and humanities. Moncrieffe is a leader in the field on research into the history of minority-ethnic group participation in competitive cycling in Britain. His groundbreaking race education work entitled 'Made in Britain: Uncovering the life-histories of Black-British Champions in Cycling' has won wide acclaim for illuminating issues of racial inequality, mono-ethnic representation and the need for broader inclusion and diversity.

The 21-year-old Louisville, KY rhymer has a strong sense of pride for his home state, shown in the cover art for his new project Confetti; a close-up photo of himself wearing a KY chain. Clearly, this is what hes about. I think its a place that people are somewhat unfamiliar with, he says. But theres a lot of culture here and I just want to put it on the map. On his new mixtape, Confetti, the follow-up to his widely-acclaimed breakthrough Loose, which was recently nominated for Best Mixtape at the 2019 BET Hip Hop Awards, he explains the main differences between 2018s Loose and Confetti is his approach to recording and songwriting, promising to bring more introspection than on his previous effort. Im talking about women. Im talking about my vices and just the way I feel at 21 years old, he says. Its personal, but it is fun. Im talking about my daily life, the things Im seeing, the things Im feeling. He is continuing to spotlight Kentucky talent with features from EST Gee and 2forwOyne, who is part of his Private Garden collective, a group of multi-faceted creatives originating from Louisville. Then theres THRU THE NIGHT featuring fellow Louisville, KY native Bryson Tiller, a dream collaboration finally realized. People wanted to hear that. I know it gives the city inspiration, he says of the two linking up. The song has a pitched-up sample of Ushers U Dont Have to Call that screams nostalgia while the music video was shot in a roller rink. Influenced by artists like Andre 3000, Missy Elliott, Drake, Eminem, Gwen Stefani, and Black Eyed Peas, Harlows mission is to prove that Kentucky can create its own unified sound. Growing up, he wanted to become a rapper because he liked expressing himself with words. The bravado and confidence that emanates from rap songs encouraged him to make his own music. He started to rap at the age of 12, remixing songs and catching some hate from his middle school peers after sharing it on Facebook. But I caught a lot of encouragement too. I got a lot of kids [saying] like, You got talent, he remembers. Once he reached high school, Harlow focused on becoming a better MC and defining his sound, dropping remixes and singles online to build his fanbase. 2017s Gazebo was Harlows breakout mixtape that explored themes of depression, vices, ex-flings, and finding yourself. Reflecting on the project, Harlow says Gazebo was settling into who I was and what I wanted to be on the record, executing an idea with 2forwOyne of making an album that felt like Louisville at night. His potential was proven on DARK KNIGHT, a two-minute lyrical onslaught over a booming beat. To date, the video has over 2.7 million views, blowing up after Harlow thought about shooting and dropping a visual on a whim after recording it. It was definitely validating, he says of the song going viral. I still feel like I got a lot of work to do, but it was definitely, [like] Shit is picking up now. He adds the success of DARK KNIGHT allowed him to go on his first tour, which is a big accomplishment in itself. Now Harlow is looking to become the new face of Kentucky. In his corner are DJ Drama and Don Cannon, his two mentors who signed him to their label Generation Now. Harlow is excited to share his new music with fans because he had a fun time creating it. Confetti was a great word for it, he says of the title, telling fans to expect a party vibe. After its release, Harlow will hit the road for The Mission Tour starting Oct. 18 in Chicago, Illinois, stopping at his hometown of Louisville, KY on November 29th, and wrapping Dec. 1 in Nashville, Tennessee. While he lists ROTTEN, DENTYNE, and WARSAW as some of his favorites off Confetti, he wants his fans to pay special attention to the albums outro RIVER ROAD. That song means a lot to me, I cant wait till people hear that. Its my most honest work ever. Overall, hes confident Confetti will go down as a certified classic. I think its the best project thats coming out this year, he says. I love it so much.", "date": "2020-10-22T19:30:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": ["united_states_events", "vermont_events", "things_to_do_in_south_burlington__vt", "south_burlington_performances", "south_burlington_music_performances"], "address": " 1214 Williston Road, South Burlington, VT 05403\n ", "city": null, "region": "Vermont", "country": "United States of America", "latitude": "44.4674315", "longitude": "-73.17241428957749"}

We decided to start The Thinking Muslim Book Club, as we want to share what we're learning and hear your thoughts too. This book club is dedicated to exploring issues in some more depth and untangling the complexities of the world around us. The club was created after we began delivering our first course, The Thinking Muslim's guide to Liberalism, in the UK. As part of the course, we regularly posted accompanying reading material on google classroom. Attendees loved it! So we wanted to extend the book suggestions to a wider audience. The plan is to select and read a book every month, then discuss the work during the months last week (to give everyone time to read it!). The journey to becoming a thinker is exciting! We will post some questions/quotes to get things started, but we would love for this to collectively grow into something amazing. If you're ready to broaden your thinking, please join up and participate. Everyone is welcome. we would be honoured! To join the book club go to Goodreads, make an account, and then put the name, The Thinking Muslim Book Club in the search box, and join, easy. We will have our first online discussion via zoom on the 29th of March, the book we have been reading is A Return to Modesty by Wendy Shalit.

In our sessions we will support each other as we navigate our new normal and we will explore how you can help your colleagues to be the teachers their students need. Throughout the three sessions you will explore your own philosophy of teaching and effectively connecting with students and colleagues. Topics include: Workshops will be virtual and two hours in length as we connect with teachers from all over the country to share our successes and our challenges as current or inspiring coaches,mentors, and teacher leaders. Details: SESSION ONE: BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS WITH STUDENTS September 29, 7:30-9:30 pm EST We know that relationships are the foundation of everything we do in our classrooms and schools. This session explores how to better connect with students and surround them with all of the support systems they deserve through successfully cultivating powerful partnerships between school, family, and home. Participants will begin with a reflective, deep dive into their core beliefs and personal educational experiences. They will identify personal barriers to overcome, those that can lead to apprehension, fear, and frustration in education. Participants will reflect on their passions, commitments, beliefs, and values that will enable them to thrive in their classrooms. Intentional in identifying an anti-racist, anti-classist, anti-sexist approach to education, we will discuss the tools and techniques for building relationships with students and families; identify why social emotional learning (SEL) is important now more than ever; differentiate between parental involvement and family engagement; the importance of avoiding assumptions; and uncover how to actively and efficiently engage all stakeholders, including the child, to yield student success. You will be introduced to Sanford Harmonys social-emotional learning platform and Sanford Inspires professional development programs to utilize as no-cost coaching and mentoring resources within your buildings. These will be used as a foundation of our discussions. SESSION TWO: NURTURING STUDENT IMAGINATION & PARENT INVOLVEMENT October 20, 7:30-9:30 pm EST Session two continues our journey in relationships with an emphasis on sport/activity coaching, instructional coaching and teacher leadership. We will discuss the power of stepping outside of the classroom silo and immersing ourselves in the school environment. There is a community beyond your classroom, in this world you can engage students, parents, and community members to learn, interact, and grow alongside educators/school leaders. There is a teacher leader in all educators and this session will help you identify your strengths and comfort levels in working with colleagues in a supportive role. We will discuss strategies that can be implemented outside of the classroom and use Sanford modules to focus our work together. SESSION THREE: COPING WITH TEACHER STRESS AND YOUR TEACHER LEADERSHIP JOURNEY November 17, 7:30-9:30 pm EST In this third and final session, we will begin to focus on the educator, more specifically the person that is responsible for our most precious cargo. We often forget about ourselves and the educators around us; we forgo our own wellbeing for our students! We are ALL finding our footing in this new world of teaching. If the last several months have taught us anything working remotely, blended, or in-person, we need to care for and advocate for ourselves before we can care for or advocate for anyone else. Though teachers often report performing leadership-like duties within their schools, the term leader is often reserved for administrative personnel only (Cherubini, 2008). Consequently, teachers are often frustrated by the systems in which they serve. In this session participants will gain a deeper understanding of Teacher Leadership. We will explore roles for teacher leaders, discuss various ways that teachers can become agents of change, identify opportunities for participants to expand their networks, and examine the three pillars of teacher leadership--Policy, Practice, and Advocacy. We will utilize Sanford Inspire and Harmony as our coaching tool and share with each other ways to coach and mentor our teachers as they navigate these important topics.

Scratch helps young people learn to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively  essential skills for life in the 21st century. Scratch is a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. It is provided free of charge. We say that learning though play happens when the activity: five characteristics of play that leads to deeper learning (1) is experienced as joyful, (2) helps children find meaning in what they are doing or learning, (3) involves active, engaged, minds-on thinking, (4) as well as iterative thinking (experimentation, hypothesis testing, etc), and (5) social interaction. These five characteristics of play draw on evidence for how children learn best (the science of learning) and how to foster a playful mindset The Program is organized around a framework that I call the Four Ps of Creative Learning: Projects, Passion, Peers, and Play. It describes why and how parents and educators should provide children with opportunities to work on projects, based on their passions, in collaboration with peers, in a playful spirit. The ultimate goal: To help children develop as creative thinkers, so that they can create new opportunities for themselves and shape the world of tomorrow Around the world, governments and companies are proclaiming that we are entering the era of AI. Using advances in artificial intelligence, companies are now producing devices that understand speech, cameras that recognize faces, cars that drive by themselves, and computers that identify patterns in huge databases of information. In the era of AI, the pace of change will continue to accelerate. Todays children will face a never-ending stream of unknown, uncertain, and unpredictable situations. The key to success and happiness will be the ability to think and act creatively. Scratch is designed especially for young people ages 8 to 16, but people of all ages create and share with Scratch. Younger children may want to try ScratchJr, a simplified version of Scratch designed for ages 5 to 7.
