Technology is being used both to deliver efficiencies in the current business model and to begin the journey towards a new one. As a result, cybersecurity itself is a critical component of those new business initiatives: digitalization means exposure and vulnerability. Because many organizations are building security capabilities almost from scratch, they have a one-off opportunity to choose the structure of their cybersecurity effort, and in particular to look at the role of outsourcing. For many organizations, a judicious mix of off-premises technologies with a reduced in-house function makes far more sense than trying to resource a fully-featured cybersecurity department. In this model, everything is up for re-evaluation. How many people are needed in the security team and what are their functions? What is the role of the CISO? An MSSP is probably needed, so who evaluates solution providers and what should they be looking for? Do they need SOC-as-a-service? What about managed SIEM-as-a-service? And, since most digital transformation involves the Cloud, how much in-house Cloud expertise is needed, how do firms maintain Cloud visibility, and how should they evaluate CASBs? The in-house expertise to build and manage this kind of hybrid cybersecurity apparatus is considerable. So what does it look like, and what is the best way forward? Securing The Law Firm will explore these and other key subjects for its audience of experts tasked with safeguarding digital assets and sensitive data.

The technical complexity of the Standard, and the granular understanding of both business and technology processes required to implement it, impose a huge burden on organizations of all sizes as digitalization of payments and commerce in general accelerates. The detail in the Standard, in contrast to the vague, principles-based approach in key data privacy legislation, places huge emphasis on tracking and monitoring access, access automation and control, ensuring effective segmentation and scoping and security testing. This means that PCI DSS compliance makes specific demands across a range of key enterprise technologies and processes. The problems for any compliance function faced with this level of complexity are manifold: does the compliance function have the required level of technical expertise? If not, does internal IT and is compliance the right team to liaise with them? And if not, who are the right people to interpret the Standard for the organization, engage third-party help, and evaluate and buy the complex solutions needed for compliance? And what kind of compliance function is equipped to monitor and test continued compliance? The difficulty is reflected in the fact that most companies review compliance just once a year  meaning that they do not comply most of the time. The difficulties are enormous, so what is the right approach and who in the enterprise should be held accountable? The 20th PCI London will look at the most recent processes and technologies used to protect personal and payment data.

The topic title for this meeting is: Bug Bounty Programs and how they are shaping Threat Research Nearly every company claims to do threat intelligence and vulnerability research, but what does that really mean? Different marketplaces exist for security research and the current black and gray markets can be as robust as their white market counterparts. At each stage of the process, information about the vulnerability equates to a monetary value and depending on how this information is disseminated, that monetary value can drastically change. Like any open market, different factors can spur changes in supply and demand, and market actors can shape what types of research either become public  or finds its way into an active exploit. Even if you dont actively join in the exploit economy, it impacts the security of your company. The most obvious way this manifests is through security patches that result from submissions to bug bounty programs, but other factors have wide-reaching impacts. Understanding the source of threat intelligence and the exploit economy is vital for getting proactive with your network defenses rather than merely reacting to threats.", "date": "2020-02-06T00:00:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": ["academic", "cybercrime", "training"], "address": null, "country": "United States of America", "region": "Illinois", "city": "Chicago", "latitude": "41.875375399999996", "longitude": "-87.62482736161188"}

In this instance, two of them really stick out. Firstly, everything is now digital, so much so that digital has lost meaning. Every workforce will be machine-run and the leftover humans will work remotely. All data and applications will be stored and conducted in the cloud (maybe). User experience is driven by continuous little hits of dopamine and instant gratification, and it must be fed at all costs! Secondly, because of all this digital expanse and surplus of data, we are constantly under attack from hackers, bots, and our very own employees  you cant trust anyone! To a degree, both are correct, but information security is still often regarded as a grudge purchase, a must-have, checking a box and moving on. For too long, security has been regarded as an add-on, a compliance issue, a laborious process that receives little fanfare or praise. But it shouldnt be that way. In fact, security should be the cornerstone of driving business value; its not just a money saver, it is, in fact, a moneymaker. CISO Africa 2020 delves into why data and IT security have greater value than merely a defensive mechanism. Designed as a peer-led conference for information security, fraud and risk professionals, the CISO Africa 2020 conference will showcase pragmatic case studies and provides high-level interactive discussions on the latest approaches and tactics to allay the bombardment of cyber-attacks, but deliver and interpret the business value.", "date": "2020-02-19T00:00:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": ["cxo_level"], "address": null, "country": "South Africa", "region": "Gauteng", "city": "Johannesburg", "latitude": "-26.205261999999998", "longitude": "28.049788308533792"}

Software frameworks like ROS gain in popularity each year. Despite the big success of software-driven robotics however, building fault-tolerant and resilient software for robotics remain a challenge. Compared to methods that are common in modern software engineering, software engineering in robotics lags behind several years due to the complexity and immaturity of the field leading to error-prone robotic systems and tedious development processes. This workshop benefits the field of robotic software engineering by promoting novel ideas, technologies, tools, and best practices for building high-quality, robust, and resilient robotic software. Feature-driven development of robotic software is still hardly possible in the environments we currently work in since the sheer complexity of the technology itself is challenging enough. With this workshop, we want to lay the foundations for a community bringing together roboticists and software people who push for developer productivity, modern methods, and tools because in the end, robots can only be good if their developers find perfect circumstances for engineering them.

Your personal information, potential threats, and your options to address those threats? The answer is surprisingly fluid, as it is with any fastchanging field. How much do you need to know about medicine to have a meaningful conversation with your doctor about your health? How much do you need to know about the law to understand and engage with your attorney? How much do you need to know about cars to talk to your mechanic? For example, you may not know precisely how your engine works, but you know what an engine is. Not so much with Cybersecurity.

Would people in Washington DC care to discuss cybersecurity when it really wasnt even on anyones radar? Winn and Bob believed it should be.

Health debates about important issues flowed effortlessly and smiles filled the room. Participants left with not only something to think about when they returned to work Monday morning but hot information that warranted timely discussions with their leadership and colleagues. Winn made the tough decision in early 2018 to pass the baton to friends and colleagues, William Kimble, Travis Hartman, and James Wright.

For this reason, it is often defined as an arms race between attackers and defenders: for example, when a new security model or algorithm is devised, it could act as a double-edged sword since it might both enhance the security posture of a system and introduce additional vulnerabilities. Similarly, many of the novel technological solutions that are used to improve the security of systems and networks are also being used by those who wish to threaten well-established algorithms and protocols. For example, it is already known that when large-scale quantum computers become available, they will be able to break almost all the public-key cryptographic algorithms currently in use. Security is also about balancing several trade-offs, e.g. security vs privacy, security vs trust, security vs usability, security vs cost, research vs standardization, academic research vs real applications, to name just a few. For example, while artificial intelligence provides the ability to efficiently analyze massive data streams to detect patterns of anomalous behaviour, it also threatens user privacy by enabling the analysis of individual behaviours, and democratic government by subverting opinions via electronic media. Likewise, the use of trustworthy computing and trusted hardware: while it fortifies systems by providing stronger security and operational assurance guarantees, it also allows attackers to perform stealthy attacks and could be used to damage user privacy.

Given the role of ICT in Africas rapid economic growth, cybersecurity breaches and attacks have the potential to slow down economic development and growth. It is urgent and important to drive the spirited conversation on Africas Industrial Control Systems security. These systems are critical systems that need special attention against cyber threat. The automation of industrial systems has steadily gained momentum while business demands continuous improvements in the efficiency of the production process, thus the depth of IT penetration and system connectivity grows continuously. The industrial facilities have been connected to corporate networks and are frequently managed remotely over the network. However, withstanding benefits, these new technologies have brought about new threats into the world of industrial automation, and these new threats came as a surprise. The Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in place today were designed to operate for decades, and many of them were developed without any serious regard to operation technology security. Single cyber-attack on the operating system can cause greater damage to the economy and even cause death. The theme for 2020 is Securing Africas ICS/SCADA Infrastructure from Cyber Vulnerabilities.

While the integration of business systems and technologies is a key enabler of digital transformation, it also expands the attack surface and potentially accelerates the speed and damage of attacks. Correlation between cyber terrain and the exploitable attack surface is leading many organizations to question whether they have the right cybersecurity tools deployed to provide visibility of their network traffic. As the cyber terrain continues to grow, organizations must evolve their defensive strategies, moving from perimeter-focused security to more comprehensive strategies that emphasize holistic visibility, detection, and the response of attacks across the cyber terrain. This can be accomplished by operationalizing cyber threat frameworks such as which provides insights both to how an attacker thinks about the target and how defenders must counter the actions taken by the attacker. Furthermore, with attackers using AI and machine learning to speed and scale attacks, it is more important than ever for cyber defenses to be able to quickly process large amounts of data and provide faster, actionable, and more automated cybersecurity decisions.

New applications, such as smart building control and virtual reality, have emerged due to a big number of resources and services brought by cloud computing. However, the delay-sensitive applications face the problem of large latency, especially when several smart devices and objects are getting involved in humans life such as the case of smart cities or the Internet of Things. Therefore, cloud computing cant meet the requirements of low latency, location awareness, and mobility support. To solve this issue, researchers have introduced a trusted and dependable solution through the Fog and the Mobile Edge Computing (FMEC) to put the resources and services of the cloud closer to users, which facilitates the leveraging of available services and resources in the edge networks. By this, we are moving from the core (cloud data centers) to the edge of the network closer to the users. FMEC dependability is based on providing user-centric service. The purpose of Fog and the Mobile Edge Computing is to run the heavy real-time applications at the network edge directly using the billions of connected mobile devices. Many features enable the Fog and the Mobile Edge Computing to be a perfect paradigm to the aforementioned purpose, which is the dense geographical deployment of servers, supporting mobility and the closeness to users. As in every new technology, some challenges face the vision of the Fog and the Mobile Edge Computing, which are the administrative policies and security concerns (i.e. secure data storage, secure computation, network security, data privacy, usage privacy, location privacy, etc). The FMEC event aims to investigate the requirements and opportunities for Mobile Edge Computing dominance. In addition, it seeks for novel contributions that aid in mitigating Mobile Edge Computing challenges. That is, the objective of FMEC is to provide a forum for engineers, scientists, and researchers to explore and exchange new ideas, novel results, and experience on all aspects of Fog and Mobile Edge Computing (FMEC).", "date": "2020-06-30T00:00:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": ["cloud_security"], "address": null, "country": "France", "region": "Ile-de-France", "city": "Paris", "latitude": "48.8565387", "longitude": "2.3518054"}

Following the presentations of the projects, a keynote speaker (to be announced) will give further remarks. The projects to be presented are: 1) Combating Domestic Terrorism. An FBI study on active shooters shows that there were on average three distinct bystanders who observed concerning behaviors about the suspect prior to their attack. Unfortunately, nearly 60 percent of bystanders did not report what they knew, resulting in many missed opportunities to save lives. Anjana Rajan will demo one way to solve this low reporting rate: through the use of a digital escrow. 2) Fair Algorithmic Housing Loans. Mortgage lenders increasingly use machine learning algorithms to make loan approval and pricing decisions.

In this talk, well share insights into how the attackers have shifted their lures and provide recommendations for improving detect and response times to reduce the likelihood these attacks will work. The open-source movement, as called in the late 1980s, has certainly changed a lot and increased in popularity. Today, Fortune 100 companies and small start-ups are using open source technologies into their environments.

Dr. Kelley Misata shares her insights and approaches in helping organizations confidently work along with side open source communities.

The projects to be presented are: 1) EdTech Equity. Black and brown students in American public schools battle discrimination in many forms. EdTech products that use AI and machine learning can amplify already existing biases and introduce new ones. Nidhi Hebbar and Madison Jacobs joined forces to enable companies, schools and parents ways to uncover and mitigate racial bias in the design and development of EdTech products. 2) Closing the Tech Funding Gap.

Historically rooted issues in terms of access to resources, democratic representation, and discrimination unfortunately still affect our world, and the technology and policy spheres are no exception. How might we harness, design, and think about how to use technology to achieve policy changes that would begin to mitigate these effects? Join Aspen Tech Policy Hub Fellows as they showcase their projects focused on Seeding Success: Equity, Technology and Policy. Following the presentations, we are thrilled to be joined by Mutale Nkonde, Founder, AI For the People, who will give further remarks on the projects and on the intersection of technology, policy, and equity. The projects to be presented are: 1) EdTech Equity. Black and brown students in American public schools battle discrimination in many forms. EdTech products that use AI and machine learning can amplify already existing biases and introduce new ones. Nidhi Hebbar and Madison Jacobs joined forces to enable companies, schools, and parents ways to uncover and mitigate racial bias in the design and development of EdTech products. 2) Closing the Tech Funding Gap. Current technology startup capitalization policies put under-represented tech startup founders at a disadvantage, and forgo an estimated 9 million jobs and $300 billion in collective national income due to discrimination. Mariah Lichtenstern led a project to address systemic issues in investor criteria, as well as other strategies to close the tech funding gap. 3) People Powered Policy. It is difficult for cities to obtain real-time feedback from their constituents on impending policy decisions and for constituents from disenfranchised communities to get the attention of elected officials. Amy Wilson led a project that develops a strategy to encourage two-way iterative communication between the city government and its constituents.", "date": "2020-07-22T00:00:00", "virtual": true, "live": false, "tags": ["cxo_level", "iot", "training"], "address": null, "country": "United States of America", "region": "California", "city": "San Francisco", "latitude": "37.7790125739737", "longitude": "-122.41997362317106"}

Following the presentations of the projects, a keynote speaker (to be announced) will give further remarks. The projects to be presented are: 1) Combating Election Disinformation by Shining Light on Dark Ads. Every day, tens of millions of Americans view political advertisements on social media that disguise themselves as unpaid content, also known as dark ads. According to NYU researchers, more than half of Facebook pages from May 2018 until June 2019 that displayed U.S. political ads concealed the identities of their backers. Matt Volk and Elizabeth Allendorf joined forces to develop a game that educates the public about dark ads, and to propose a series of actions that regulatory entities can take to increase transparency in this ecosystem. 2) Using Automated Advocates to Provide Legal Services at Scale. The United States faces a crisis in its civil courts, where more than 80% of low-income households lack adequate legal representation. A promising new class of technology tools (Automated Advocates) can help close that gap, but regulatory complexity about who may practice law make it difficult for companies to build these tools and for regulators to distinguish good actors from bad.

Submissions that model a scientific approach to cybersecurity are especially encouraged, as well as those that advance the infrastructure of cybersecurity science. Significant challenges abound. For example, experiments should operate in realistic environments, yet identifying salient features and modeling them in testbeds is hard. Repeatability is a worthy goal, but not always feasible. Few security-relevant datasets are publicly available for research use and little is understood about what good datasets look like. Cybersecurity experiments and performance evaluations carry significant risks if not properly contained and controlled, yet often require some degree of interaction with the larger world in order to be useful; hence, ethical issues often arise.

Research in these areas has made substantial progress in providing a better understanding of the various aspects of the Internet of Things, data science, and their integration through the development of a number of models. Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to simulate human intelligence in machines programmed to think like humans and imitate their actions. The term can also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving. It is at the heart of many high-performance applications that shape our daily lives and others that are very promising are about to come. IoT represents a system of computer devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals, or people interconnected that can communicate data via a network in an autonomous manner, in real-time, and without any human interaction. Since its appearance, several IOT applications have emerged to answer a set of challenges of various domains such as Education, and Agriculture, which shows that the scope of the IoT is almost unlimited. The combination of AI and IoT transforms and enriches the two technologies: AI brings its machine learning capabilities to objects, and IoT brings to AI connectivity, signaling, and exchange of data. The union of AI and IoT essentially aims to integrate cognitive computing into consumer devices and in terms of data analysis, the A2IOT combines machine learning with networks and IoT systems to create learning machines. The aim is also to provide an overview of recent advances and challenges in artificial intelligence, the internet of things and their integration, and in particular to solicit contributions on real-world applications. Furthermore, this workshop offers an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to identify new promising research directions as well as to publish recent advances in this area.

Blind SQL Injection:- Blind SQL injection is a type of SQL Injection attack that asks the database true or false questions and determines the answer based on the applications response. This attack is often used when the web application is configured to show generic error messages but has not mitigated the code that is vulnerable to SQL injection. Ansh Bhawnani is an independent Security Researcher and Hackfluencer. Unrestricted File Upload:- Uploaded files represent a significant risk to applications. The first step in many attacks is to get some code to the system to be attacked. Then the attack only needs to find a way to get the code executed. Using a file upload helps the attacker accomplish the first step. Raju Kumar is currently a Synack Red Team member. He has participated in many bug bounties program & Recognised by many Companies like Dell, Mastercard, Netgear, DigitalOcean, Western Union, Genymotion, and many more for finding a critical vulnerability in their website.", "date": "2020-08-23T00:00:00", "virtual": true, "live": false, "tags": ["academic", "cxo_level", "web_application_security"], "address": null, "country": "India", "region": "Madhya Pradesh", "city": "Indore", "latitude": "22.72037570412495", "longitude": "75.86795947453938"}

Whereas in the past, all the systems of the chassis were controlled by separate ECUs, companies in the automotive domain are now working towards combining these systems and creating a global, vehicle level, control architecture. This, of course, brings new challenges to the table, not only of technical nature but also of organizational and even political one. Looking at furthering the efficiency of modern vehicles, x-by-wire systems play a special role. The prospect of not having heavy, spacious mechanical components, but instead electronic commands to actuators control the vehicle motion, is a good one and a lot of R&D activities are directed towards introducing cost-efficient and reliable by-wire systems into the car. In this conference, you will learn from top experts from OEMs and Tier1s and their suppliers, how to tackle the challenges associated with introducing these new technologies.

To improve security, technology must adapt to the users, because research in social sciences and usable security has demonstrated that insecure behavior can be justified from cognitive, emotional, and social perspectives. However, also adherence to reasonable security policies and corresponding behavioral changes should augment and support technical security. Finding the right balance between the technical and social security measures remains largely unexplored, which motivates the need for this workshop. Currently, different security communities (theoretical security, systems security, usable security, and security management) rarely work together. There is no established holistic research in security, and the respective communities tend to offload on each other parts of problems that they consider to be out of scope, an attitude that results in deficient or unsuitable security solutions. The workshop intends to stimulate an exchange of ideas and experiences on how to design systems that are secure in the real world where they interact with non-expert users. It aims at bringing together experts in various areas of computer security and in social and behavioral sciences.", "date": "2020-09-18T00:00:00", "virtual": true, "live": false, "tags": ["academic", "iot", "risk"], "address": null, "country": "United Kingdom", "region": "England", "city": null, "latitude": "51.235490805292", "longitude": "-0.5731891626891739"}

Nope. The idea behind x33fcon (pronounced /zif-kn/) is to focus on a very specific need of the security industry: collaboration between red and blue teams (sometimes referred to as purple teaming). It is hard to build a solid bridge between those who assess security and those who guard the castle. Many misconceptions and misunderstandings arise between these two groups. That is what the conference wants to change. Rather than continue to think about security from either a defensive or offensive perspective, the goal is to encourage security experts to consider both perspectives while working more closely together.

However, the design and engineering of such technologies often ignore the organizational context that respective technologies are to be applied in. A large and hierarchical organization, for example, calls for significantly different security and privacy practices and respective technologies than an agile, small startup. Similarly, whenever employees behavior plays a significant role in the ultimate level of security and privacy provided, their individual interests and incentives as well as typical behavioral patterns must be taken into account and materialized in concrete technical solutions and practices. Even though research on security- and privacy-related technologies increasingly considers questions of practical applicability in realistic scenarios, implementation decisions are still mostly technology-driven, and existing technical limitations and notions of this is how weve always done it hamper innovation. On the other hand, a substantial body of organization-related security and privacy research already exists, incorporating aspects like decision and governance structures, individual interests and incentives of employees, organizational roles and procedures, organizational as well as national culture, or business models and organizational goals. However, there is still a large gap between the generation of respective insights and their actual incorporation in concrete technical mechanisms, frameworks, and systems. This disconnection between rather technical and rather organization-related security and privacy research leaves substantial room for improving the fit between organizational practices on the one and the engineering of concrete technologies on the other hand. Achieving a better fit between these two sides through security and privacy technologies that soundly incorporate organizational and behavioral theories and practices promises substantial benefits for organizations and data subjects, engineers, policymakers, and society as a whole. The aim of this workshop is, therefore, to discuss, exchange, and develop ideas and questions regarding the design and engineering of technical security and privacy mechanisms with particular reference to organizational contexts. We invite papers from researchers and practitioners working in security- and privacy-related systems engineering as well as in the field of organizational science to submit their original papers to this workshop.", "date": "2020-09-15T00:00:00", "virtual": true, "live": false, "tags": ["privacy"], "address": null, "country": "United Kingdom", "region": "England", "city": null, "latitude": "51.235490805292", "longitude": "-0.5731891626891739"}

The major driving factors are the ever-increasing coverage of Internet connectivity, the extreme popularity, and the capillarity of smartphones, tablets, and wearables, together with the consolidation of the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. As a matter of fact, interconnected devices directly control and take decisions on industrial processes, regulate infrastructures and services in smart cities, and manage quality-of-life and safety in smart-homes, taking decisions with user interactions or even autonomously. The involvement of these devices in so many applications, unfortunately, introduces a set of unavoidable security and safety implications, related to both the criticality of the aforementioned applications and to the privacy of sensitive information produced and exploited in the process. To address these and other related issues, there is an increasing need for instruments to control the access and the right to perform specific actions on devices or data. These instruments need to be able to cope with the high complexity of the considered applications and environments, being flexible and adaptable to different contexts and architectures, from centralized to fully-distributed, able to handle a high amount of information as well as taking into account non-conventional trust assumptions. The considered technologies should regulate the actions of both human users and autonomous devices, being effective in enforcing security policies, still without introducing noticeable overhead, both on the side of performance and user experience. Hence, the design of secure and efficient mechanisms for continuous authentication, requiring limited-to-no active interaction is solicited. The ETAA workshop aims at being a forum for researchers and practitioners of security activities in the field of new technologies for authenticating users and devices and enforce security policies in new and emerging applications related to mobile/wearable devices and IoT.", "date": "2020-09-14T00:00:00", "virtual": true, "live": false, "tags": ["academic", "iot"], "address": null, "country": "United Kingdom", "region": "England", "city": "Mole Valley", "latitude": "51.2677265", "longitude": "-0.3399081344933217"}

At present, there are major issues with misaligned software applications related to human factors, such as accessibility, usability, emotions, personality, age, gender, and culture. This workshop serves as the ideal venue to share research ideas and outcomes on requirements, theory, models, tools, and capability for next-generation human-centric software engineering aiming to achieve significant benefits of greatly improved software quality and user experience, developer productivity, and cost savings. In addition, this workshop has a special focus on cybersecurity. The increased attention to a human-centric design in software engineering is the focus of contemporary research in cybersecurity. Particularly, the focus is shifting towards embedding human behavior and cognitive perception to ensure fully human-centric cybersecurity that not only protects humans from the harmful aftereffects of cybersecurity events but does so in unison with human thinking and behavioral patterns.

Enterprise business processes and their supporting systems have to constantly evolve in order to comply with security and privacy policies. Complex organizational structures and their distributed business processes make such compliance a major effort. Moreover, the intersection between privacy and security technologies and software engineering has tremendous implications on the very way information systems are modeled for their design and development. These changes affect the requirements and software engineering processes in organizations. That is why security and privacy requirements have to be explicitly addressed in enterprise models while technologies supporting security and privacy have to become an integrated part of Enterprise Architecture. Emerging technologies such as distributed ledgers, privacy-enhancing technologies, and blockchains leverage powerful cryptography features, all-purpose Turing-complete programming languages, and flexible communication models. They are considered as new transparency security and privacy enablers for distributed processing without requiring a trusted third-party. Today, their integration within information systems is a difficult task for enterprise architects due to the paradigm-shifting nature of those technologies and the lack of adequate models and tools from the enterprise modeling community. This paradigmatic shift can also be explained with privacy-enhancing technologies coming from a tradition of privacy as confidentiality. This area is under-explored and yet to be understood. The goal of PriSEM20 is to bring together researchers and practitioners to discuss theoretical and practical problems and solutions in a rapidly maturing domain of enterprise security and privacy.

Until recently risks were, in general, restricted to information security, network security, and application security ensuring the confidentiality, the availability, and the integrity of data, but with the Internet-of-Things, we are seamlessly connecting the cyber and the physical worlds extending the risk area to safety requiring a broader perspective on security. Internet-of-Things is turning out to be one of the weakest spots in our infrastructure. With billions and in the near future potentially trillions of devices, the security risks are growing at great rates. Our economic and societal forces are creating a perfect storm, a pervasive infrastructure of trillions of Internet-of-Things devices which on one hand will oversee our lives and economy, and on the other hand, will be completely unmanageable from a security perspective. We are at a watershed moment in history and unless we take action immediately, we run the risk of being overcome by technology that will fundamentally and irreversibly undermine our cybersecurity and our safety.

With the maturity of cloud services and the significant amount of resources cloud service providers have invested in securing their offerings, CSA has witnessed an upwards shift in the prominence of key cloud security issues. With the cloud security focus now shifting upwards, cloud users need to be crystal clear about the shared responsibility model of the cloud and brush up security postures of what they have implemented in the user space of the technology stack. Join leading experts with domain proficiency and expertise to discuss the key issues and trends facing cloud security and cybersecurity today at this 3-day virtual Summit organized by CSA APAC on 20-22 October 2020. Earn up to 12 CPE Credits. Cloud computing is one of the key drivers for achieving an organizations mission and is finally becoming a new norm. As a result, cloud spending will continue to grow, making it the top investment area for enterprises. But the complexity of the cloud can be the perfect place for attackers to hide, offering concealment as a launchpad for further harm. Unawareness of the threats, risks, and vulnerabilities makes it more challenging to protect organizations from data loss. Sessions on this day will provide needed context to assist organizations in making educated risk management decisions regarding their cloud adoption strategies. Cloud technologies and traditional security processes are as bad a match as stripes and polka dots. They simply arent built to mix well together. As companies adopt cloud technologies, security teams are scrambling to apply what they know to this new way of doing business. But theyre quickly realizing how different an on-prem mindset is from one thats geared to the cloud. Sessions on this day will define ways you can effectively shift your security paradigm so its suited to a cloud-defined world. With cloud as the dominant IT environment and nearly every organization and government leveraging it to some degree, it is not enough to stay on top of whats happening today.

Delivering critical content and experiences via remote learning is top of mind, but there are unique identity risks and potential breaches that also need to be addressed to ensure safety for all stakeholders. Phishing attacks and use of stolen credentials accounted for 51% of breaches in educational services, according to Verizons 2020 Data Breach Investigations Report.

The global economy is on the verge of unprecedented collapse, and the world population is staying at home. While it is crushing the healthcare systems, it has also revealed how unprepared and vulnerable cyberspace is in the face of a pandemic. Organizations around the world are watching their threat surface multiply as employees are operating outside the direct supervision of their specialized IT infrastructure. Account takeovers and data-scraping attacks on e-commerce websites have increased with the surge of the pandemic. Emails are being hit by phishing scams and malware schemes which are promising economic stimulus checks. Social networks are flooded with fake information and stalkers are taking advantage of fake pandemic tracking mobile apps. Sadly, it seems like the privacy debate is finally over as the government needs to deploy large surveillance operations to track people in order to contain the pandemic.

Wells, The War of the Worlds, which converted the (at the time) 40-year-old novel into fake news bulletins describing a Martian invasion of New Jersey, The of the Worlds is not FAKE NEWS. Neither H.G. Wells, Orson Welles, or anyone who remembers the early days of Yellow Journalism could have imagined the levels of disinformation that modern society would rise to. No one could have foreseen how modern warfare would transform from the 1938 Blitzkrieg tactics to trillions of dollars being stolen without the firing of a single shot. Wells envisioned an alien robot invasion from Mars, but what he could not yet imagine with his access to 1938 technology is a real future where humans would build the software and machines that would wreak the most damage. 2020 sees a true Cyber War of the Worlds that fans of the Orwellian utopia 1984 would scarcely believe. Computers, software, and the internet are being exploited to carry out zillions of attacks such as Phishing, Ransomware, DeepFakes, and even Drones equipped with Pineapple devices to scour the landscape for consumer data on public Wi-Fi networks. We have created the aliens that HG Welles imagined could destroy our cities. Cyber War of the Worlds is more dangerous than science fiction could ever imagine and scarier than an alien attack from Mars. Its here, its real, and when you see a drone fly by, stop and notice how much it resembles a UFO. What would Wells or even Welles think if they saw a childs drone flying by in their time?

There are many recent examples of attacks that exploit IoT devices to perform large-scale distributed denial of service attacks, to spy on people, and to hijack communication links, therefore delivering full control of anything that is remotely accessible to an attacker. Those attacks deeply affect the operation of a number of services that are vital for society functioning as energy, transport, communications, and so on. Moreover, IoT is largely used in monitoring activities of complex systems as smart city, industrial plant, health systems, bridges, and so forth. Because of that, if an IoT system experiences an attack, it should still exhibit resilience in the form of graceful degradation and/or survival and fast recovery (bounce-back/bounce-forward) of the functionality from the eventual failure or misbehavior. IoT resilience is here to understand the strategies and methods for a cyber-attack absorption and infrastructure operational recovery and needs to be considered as an integral part of the IoT Cyber Security landscape.

When trusted insiders disclose sensitive information to the public or adversaries, they degrade and disrupt our ability to conduct intelligence missions and can put many people at risk. Often, insider threats are perpetuated by unknowing and unwitting employees, rather than those with malignant intentions. Regardless of the motivations, the consequences of Insider Threat can be catastrophic. COVID 19s sudden and dramatic impact on the workforce creates a significant challenge for those involved in countering insider threats. Employees are now more likely to be working outside of a controlled environment, making monitoring and support even more difficult. This once-in-a-generation pandemic has increased stressors on the workforce that in turn increase the likelihood of becoming an insider threat. Government agencies have struggled with combatting this threat and investing sufficiently into InT programs. Insider threat is a complex challenge due to its ever-evolving nature. Organizations must look at behavioral, financial, and cultural indicators, in addition to implementing data security measures. Successful programs require a blend of educational and analytic capabilities to be effective. Speakers from the IC, DoD, DOJ, industry, and academia will discuss the obstacles in developing operational insider threat programs and examine the ways in which private-public collaboration can mutually solve many of the challenges faced by both sectors.

As a result, many services ensured by each city, such as transportation, buildings, healthcare, education, agriculture, and energy management are becoming more and more intelligent. Moreover, Artificial Intelligence (AI) represents a promising solution to bring intelligence into different entities of smart cities. However, the process of integration brings new challenges and problems. In addition, security is one of the important challenges that arise since smart city applications not only collect a wide range of sensitive information from users and their mobile applications but also control access to different resources of the city. In this session, the event will be focusing on artificial intelligence and security-related problems that currently affect smart cities in general around the world. For this, the objective of this Workshop is to bring together researchers to discuss recent algorithms and solutions related to both problems.

As a computer security venue, NSPW is unique in format and highly interactive in nature. Each paper is typically the focus of 45 to 60 minutes of presentation and discussion. Authors are encouraged to present ideas that might be considered risky in some other forum, and all participants are charged with providing feedback in a constructive manner. The resulting intensive brainstorming has proven to be an excellent medium for furthering the development of these ideas.

However, when we look around us and observe what existing, real-world robots can actually do we are faced with a different reality as robots do fail, they are not perfect, and they eventually make mistakes. Until now, most approaches in were centered around a single metaphor, striving towards a human-like, utilitarian, can-do-it-all robot. While this strategy has advantages, it also places unrealistic expectations for robots, which frequently result in disappointment when interacting with them. In this workshop, we call for exploring alternative designs for social robots to cultivate new perspectives on robots, outside the existing norms. Alternative metaphors have been previously successful in breaking through fixation and bringing novel design and products. Furthermore, metaphors can serve as a vessel to wider societal imaginaries of technology and progress. This is the 1st Edition of the Workshop, held virtually and in conjunction with ICSR 2020. The aim of this half-day workshop is to use metaphors to reinvent how robots can interact with humans, re-imagine alternative physical shapes for robots, and open up a conversation about the role robots might have in societies.

Sensors and sensor networks have become a highly active research area because of their potential of providing diverse services to a broad range of applications, not only on science and engineering, but equally importantly on issues related to critical infrastructure protection and security, health care, the environment, energy, food safety, and the potential impact on the quality of all areas of life. Sensor networks and sensor-based systems support many applications today on the ground. Underwater operations and applications are quite limited by comparison. Most applications refer to remotely controlled submersibles and wide-area data collection systems at a coarse granularity. Underwater sensor networks have many potential applications such as seismic imaging of undersea oilfields as a representative application. Oceanographic research is also based on advances in underwater data collection systems. There are specific technical aspects to realize underwater applications which can not be borrowed from the ground-based sensors net research. Radio is not suitable for underwater systems because of extremely limited propagation. Acoustic telemetry could be used in underwater communication; however off-the-shelf acoustic modems are not recommended for underwater sensor networks with hundreds of nodes because they were designed for long-range and expensive. As the speed of light (radio) is five orders of magnitude higher than the speed of sound, there are fundamental implications of time synchronization and propagation delays for localization. Additionally, existing communication protocols are not designed to deal with long sleep times and they cant shut down and quickly restart. In wireless sensor and micro-sensor networks, energy consumption is a key factor for the sensor lifetime and accuracy of information. Protocols and mechanisms have been proposed for energy optimization considering various communication factors and types of applications. Conserving energy and optimizing energy consumption are challenges in wireless sensor networks, requiring energy-adaptive protocols, self-organization, and balanced forwarding mechanisms. As a multi-track event, SENSORCOMM 2020 will serve as a forum for researchers from academia and the industry, professionals, standard developers, policymakers, and practitioners to exchange ideas.

Security affects business and individuals, raises the business risk, and requires a corporate and individual culture. In the open business space offered by the Internet, it is a need to improve defenses against hackers, disgruntled employees, and commercial rivals. There is a required balance between the effort and resources spent on security versus security achievements. Some vulnerability can be addressed using the rule of 80:20, meaning 80% of the vulnerabilities can be addressed for 20% of the costs. Other technical aspects are related to the communication speed versus complex and time-consuming cryptography/security mechanisms and protocols. Digital Ecosystem is defined as an open decentralized information infrastructure where different networked agents, such as enterprises (especially SMEs), intermediate actors, public bodies, and end-users, cooperate and compete enabling the creation of new complex structures. In digital ecosystems, the actors, their products, and services can be seen as different organisms and species that are able to evolve and adapt dynamically to changing market conditions. Digital Ecosystems lie at the intersection between different disciplines and fields: industry, business, social sciences, biology, and cutting edge ICT and its application-driven research. They are supported by several underlying technologies such as semantic web and ontology-based knowledge sharing, self-organizing intelligent agents, peer-to-peer overlay networks, web services-based information platforms, and recommender systems. To enable safe digital ecosystem functioning, security, and trust mechanisms become essential components across all the technological layers.

BSides conferences have three event styles which are Structured, Unconference, and Hybrid. A Structured event follows the traditional conference model and often happens in tandem with other bigger conferences such as RSA, Black Hat, DEFCON and more. Attendees typically intermingle and attend one or more events. Talks are submitted to the local event ahead of time, selected, and scheduled prior to the start of the conference. In the Unconference event style, its completely attendee driven. Attendees appear at a predetermined time, discuss ideas, and collaboratively agree upon what the schedule will look like for that day. Talks that get the most attention and conversation get added to the schedule.

Recent meetings have been held in Xian (China), Jeju (Korea), Cairns (Australia). ProvSec 2020 will be the first time this event is held in Singapore. Provable security is an essential tool for analyzing the security of modern cryptographic primitives in order to achieve high assurance of trusted and secure cyber systems. The research community has witnessed the great contributions that the provable security methodology made to the analysis of cryptographic schemes and protocols, as well as their implementations in the trusted and secure systems. Nowadays cryptographic primitives without a rigorous proof cannot be regarded as sound. Also, the methodology has been used to discover security flaws in the implementation of cryptographic schemes and protocols, which were considered seemingly secure without formal analysis. On the one hand, provable security provides confidence in using cryptographic schemes and protocols for various real-world applications, but on the other hand, schemes with provable security are sometimes not efficient enough to be used in practice, and correctness of the proofs may be difficult to verify. This year we will continue our efforts to promote into the theme. The event will bring together researchers and practitioners to provide a confluence of new practical cybersecurity technologies, including their applications and their integration with IT systems in various industrial sectors.

These steps have to be repeated for every physical device examined in the criminal case. Conventional digital forensics data preprocessing and analysis methods struggle when handling the contemporary variety, variability, volume, and velocity of case data. Thus, proactive approaches have to be developed and integrated into daily law enforcement operations; for timely detection and prevention of illegal activities in data-intensive environments.

In response to that, cyber defenders transition from manual and reactive approaches to more automated and proactive. A key element for building a robust security posture against adversarial attacks is Cyber threat intelligence (CTI). CTI allows security teams to benefit from increased situational awareness and thus minimize their organizations attack surfaces. Based on the detection maturity of an organization, such intelligence can update cyber defense components in an automated manner based on the established trust between the entity sharing the intelligence and the entity consuming it, or in more proactive approaches such as threat hunting and risk assessment. For example, TTPs used in adversarial activities can support threat hunting efforts where the objective is to detect unidentified malicious activity that evaded existing security solutions. The CyberHunt workshop aims to present (potentially AI-focused) new research in the areas of cyber-threat hunting, cyber-threat intelligence, and security orchestration, automation, and response.

Due to the evolving COVID situation, DYNAMICS will be held virtually. Machine learning has become critical to the evolution and sustainability of cybersecurity. While the theoretical objectives and principles behind cybersecurity are still valid, traditional technologies that require humans in the loop to read log files, triage alerts, and harden devices are neither fast enough nor scalable enough to meet the demands of modern networks and attacks. While network traffic and devices have grown by orders of magnitude, the ability for operators to triage the resulting alerts has not. The sophistication of threats has also increased substantially. Sophisticated zero-day attacks go undetected for months at a time. Attacks take place over extended periods, effectively outwaiting traditional intrusion detection technology. Worse, new attack tools and strategies can now be developed using adversarial machine learning techniques, requiring rapid co-evolution of defenses that match the speed and sophistication of machine learningbased offensive techniques. This is intended to focus on novel applied and theoretical work that combines machine learning techniques such as reinforcement learning, adversarial machine learning, and deep learning with significant problems in cybersecurity.

Most internet companies need to leverage user-level data from different sources to understand how users interact with their products in various scenarios and contexts. Quantitative techniques would increase the generalizability of research conclusions regarding user mental models to provide frameworks for user understanding. On the other hand, large scale data can be critical to customize approaches in gaining user traction, improve user experience, and monetization for different user groups. Weve seen tremendous applications in this space, including but not limited to the recommendation, marketing, online experiments, to name just a few. Fundamental understanding also requires methods such as statistical sampling, data visualization, funnel analysis, experimental design, causal inference, etc. This workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers from related fields to exchange ideas on how to use data-driven technologies for better user understanding through data analytics & modeling, experimental design, and user research. The workshop will focus on both theoretical and practical challenges.

Dynamic scalability or elasticity provided by the cloud makes high-performance computing accessible to everyone. However, cloud computing introduces new challenges with respect to security and privacy. Although virtualization addresses some of these concerns, it has a significant impact on performance: the actual gains in performance depend heavily on the predictability of physical and virtualized resources. Consequently, the balancing of performance against security and the adaptation of HPC or VLDB techniques to cloud computing are of strategic importance and will have a long-lasting scientific impact.

The Internet of Things (IoT) evolution has given birth to several new groundbreaking applications, such as the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), smart cities, and cyber-physical systems (CPS). In the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), the vehicles include several sensors and cameras to obtain and communicate information from their surroundings. This information can be helpful in safe navigation, detecting hurdles, optimizing routes, and traffic management. For efficient decision making, in IoVs, we use Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication to complement on-board sensors inputs and provide better services. A key concern when relying on sensor-data is the vulnerability of data. Malicious actors tend to inject false data or alter communication among normal vehicles. Therefore, there is a need to discuss the solutions that provide authentication to both communicating entities and secure data from malicious entities. This workshop will publish state-of-the-art approaches to secure the IoV infrastructure. Specifically, ASP-IoV workshop will provide a high-quality forum for participants across research and industry. Organizers aim to attract contributions from both academic and industrial organizations addressing emerging security and privacy issues in distributed sensor networks and IoV and to publish consolidated research results focusing on analyzing security and privacy threats, applying cutting-edge technologies to provide secure and privacy-preserving communications in this field. Papers may present advances in the theory, design, implementation, analysis, verification, or empirical evaluation and measurement of the area. Papers that shed new light on past or informally known results by means of sound formal theory or thorough empirical analysis will also be welcomed.", "date": "2020-12-07T00:00:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": ["academic", "blockchain", "machine_learning", "transport"], "address": null, "country": "Taiwan", "region": null, "city": "Taipei", "latitude": "25.0374227", "longitude": "121.5641067"}

Cyber Security risks continue to evolve as well in both quantity in the same domains as well as new types and ways on how to break into computing systems, software applications, websites, databases, programmable networks, etc. For example, monitoring the car manufacturing industry, we can see that recent car models have more complex hardware components and automated programmable features in comparison with their earlier models, this will increase the risk associated with protecting such systems. The same thing can be applicable to most other engineering products. Such complex hardware and programmable techniques bring security opportunities to change the way cybersecurity controls (e.g. firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), etc.) are developed and enforced. They also bring security challenges related to our computing systems and software architectures or any changes that can be directly or indirectly related to them due to the complex interactions between them. The 3rd International Symposium on Future Cyber Security Technologies (FCST 2020) will focus on issues related to future cybersecurity challenges as well as opportunities that mainly highlight the above-mentioned aspects.

As we are deep into the Information Age, huge amounts of data are generated every day from sensors, individual archives, social networks, Internet of Things, enterprises, and the Internet in various scales and formats which will pose a major challenge to the dependability of our designed systems. These systems often tend to become inert, fragile, and vulnerable after a period of running. Effectively improving the dependability of sensors, cloud, big data systems, and applications has become increasingly critical. This conference provides a forum for individuals, academics, practitioners, and organizations who are developing or procuring sophisticated computer systems on whose dependability of services they need to place great confidence. Future systems need to close the dependability gap in the face of challenges in different circumstances. The emphasis will be on differing properties of such services, e.g., continuity, effective performance, real-time responsiveness, ability to overcome data fault, corruption, anomaly, ability to avoid catastrophic failures, prevention of deliberate privacy intrusions, reliability, availability, sustainability, adaptability, heterogeneity, security, safety, and so on.", "date": "2020-12-14T00:00:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": ["academic", "artificial_intelligence", "blockchain", "cloud_security", "iot", "privacy"], "address": null, "country": "Fiji", "region": "Central", "city": null, "latitude": "-17.937998", "longitude": "178.41817157148424"}

Such an increase in the population demands a boost of almost 70 percent in the food production rate, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. This rapidly growing population also introduces a variety of other problems such as increasing competition and exploitation of land, water, and other natural resources. These issues present an urgent need to reduce the dependence of the food system on our environment. Consequently, the need for an evolutionary agricultural paradigm to keep up with the growing demand for food and crop production is necessary to guarantee sustainable development. Most recently, smart and precision agriculture is gaining more traction among industry and academia. Several enterprises are developing novel big data-driven solutions for this evolving technology domain, but at the same time also raising security and privacy concerns to the introduction of sensors, big data, and AI in the conventional agriculture sector. The USDA also issued a white paper that envisages different applications and also highlights security concerns in this economically important sector for an agriculture dominant nation. This workshop aims to bring together the experts from the agriculture, IoT, CPS, AI, and smart applications domain to develop synergy and exchange ideas to ensure secure smart agriculture applications. We envision developing this workshop as a premier platform for research on data-driven applications aspects in the smart agriculture domain. We will invite submissions in areas (but not limited to) related to novel data-driven applications, smart technologies, architectures, and security solutions in smart agriculture areas including livestock, dairy, fisheries, smart greenhouse, food supply chain, and other synergistic domains.", "date": "2020-12-10T00:00:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": ["academic", "artificial_intelligence", "iot"], "address": null, "country": "United States of America", "region": "Georgia", "city": "Atlanta", "latitude": "33.748619500000004", "longitude": "-84.39077255017861"}

For instance, machine learning methods have been used to analyze the behaviors of the data stream in networks and extract the patterns of malicious activities (packet dropping, worm propagation, jammer attacks, etc.) for generating rules in intrusion detection systems. Furthermore, time-series methods (e.g. local outlier factor, cumulative sum, adaptive online thresholding, etc.) have been proposed to retrieve the time-series features of anomalous behaviors for preventing cyber-attacks and malfunctions. While the area of machine learning methods for trust, security, and privacy in computing and communications is a rapidly expanding field of scientific research, several open research questions are still needed to be discussed and studied. For instance, using and improving machine learning methods for malicious activity detection, attack detection, mobile endpoint analyses, repetitive security task automation, zero-day vulnerability prevention, and other security applications are the important issues in computing and communications.

The resulting system is very complex, especially when several CPS need to be combined to achieve a common goal. Being the consumers of such a large yet complex networked CPS environment, we typically overlook the underlying Security, Trustworthiness, and Privacy (STP) aspects. In addition, the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and technology are being increasingly deployed as consumer gadgets that are constantly interacting with the physical world to achieve real-time situational awareness for the users. However, the effectiveness of CPS in the consumer market is significantly contingent on the remediation of cybersecurity risks, the establishment of complete trust, and resilient privacy-aware communication techniques. The consequences of unintentional misconduct or malicious attacks could have severe repercussions on human lives as well as the environment. Therefore, secure, trustworthy, and privacy-aware CPS has become an important research direction in academia, industry, and government agencies due to its crucial importance to improve the quality of service and accuracy of situational awareness. Over the past decade, Software-Defined Networking (SDN) has become a promising technology for dealing with open issues and challenges in the cellular network. Considering the strength of the SDN features, the integration of SDN and CPS would be efficient enough to provide scalable, reliable, secure, and efficient communication in the heterogeneous infrastructure. On the other hand, the features of Blockchain technology can also be used to increase the reliability and robustness of the CPS network. It has the potential to ensure trust in information transactions executed autonomously between CPS without the need for a trusted third party. However, the integration of such cutting-edge solutions in CPS must be well explored to enable a paradigm shift and develop innovative approaches to achieve STP in emerging CPS. The workshop will serve as a forum for sharing experiences and outcomes with protocol design, real testbeds, experimental evaluation, prototyping, and empirical characterization of innovative approaches that address security, trust, and privacy challenges of emerging CPS environments. This workshop will also facilitate discussions on unresolved issues in the field, such as blockchain-based security solutions of critical infrastructures, secure and resilient system architectures, protocols and applications for software CPS environment, SDN capabilities in critical CPS infrastructures, and other key challenges in the emerging software-defined CPS.

With the accelerated advances of communications and storage technologies, access to critical information acquired from various sensors and sources, e.g., land cameras, satellite data, drones, personal devices, has been significantly eased. Manipulation and processing of such a high amount of diverse data is still a steady challenge, and most of the existing solutions involve the use of human resources. However, threats are now at a very large scale, requiring very different security solutions which are able to make use of interdisciplinary approaches. In this context, computer-assisted or automated technologies are now becoming more and more attractive to substitute expensive human resources in the decisional systems. RISS 2020 focuses on discussing solutions provided by Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems to the aforementioned challenges. It aims to bring together researchers from academia and industry, end-users, law-enforcing agencies, and citizen groups to share experiences and explore multi- and inter-disciplinary areas where additional research and development are needed, identify possible collaboration and consider the societal impact of such technologies.", "date": "2021-01-10T00:00:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": ["academic", "machine_learning"], "address": null, "country": "Italy", "region": "Lombardy", "city": "Milan", "latitude": "45.46661225", "longitude": "9.190809530166042"}

If you love security, hacking, cutting edge research, Goa, trance, then the universe will conspire to send you to nullcon.  Submitting early increases the chance of acceptance in the first round of review itself. The more you delay the more competition you have with other papers that are submitted later.  The more concrete technical details you provide the better chance you have of getting accepted. Reviewers usually give a low score to submissions that have very small or vague abstract and may not request for more details. The best way is to provide a supporting full technical paper that explains all the vulnerabilities, exploits, etc. in detail.  Please take rejection as a suggestion for improvement somewhere in the paper and not as an offense. Declining a paper does not mean your submission is not good. There are many parameters we look at when reviewing a paper, technical in-depth is only one of them. Many times, we have to let go of really good talks because there is already an accepted paper on a similar subject or too many good submissions or your submission is already presented/published elsewhere. We want you to succeed and are only trying to help you in preparing you for future submissions. So, cheer up and get ready for the next submission.  We do not ask our review board for comments.

Pharmaceutical companies have to resist the challenges looming from supply chain security lapses to avoid infiltration of counterfeit, diverted, and adulterated drugs entering into the supply chain. Apart from having an end to end visibility and traceability within the supply chain, effective serialization programs will be a key differentiator and will be a competitive advantage for the pharmaceutical companies. Drug counterfeiting is not only a global public health risk but also harms the quality of the product, the integrity of the brand, the economy, and even national security. Revenues from the pharma and bio-pharma counterfeit market are estimated to be more than $200 billion. Aligning your anti-counterfeiting strategy with the corporate supply chain strategy should plot a roadmap for implementing anti-counterfeiting measures. Both industry and governments across the world recognizing the importance of implementing product serialization, it becomes obligatory for all entities within the supply chain to comply with federal or state legislation pertaining to the locations in which they operate. Initiatives focusing on supply chain monitoring, such as mass serialization, track, and trace, or hologram tagging, had mixed outcomes, as counterfeiters are agile and have found ways to bypass the steps quickly. Pharmaceutical companies and regulators are still developing techniques to stop them by creating an intelligence-led brand protection strategy. This also reveals numerous gaps in the governmental and industry efforts to safeguard global pharmaceutical and biotech supplies. Corvus Global Events invites you to 3rd Annual Pharma Supply Chain & Security World 2020  Supply-chain, Drug Serialization and Anti-Counterfeiting conference, which will have Pharma industry experts sharing various challenges faced, new strategies, case studies and use of innovative ideas, the conference will also offer opportunities to encourage partnerships and collaborations.

Unfortunately, most innovative systems and applications, such as: Industrial IoT, Smart Environments, Mashups, NewSQL, suffer from a lack of dependability and security, which is fueled by global scale, mobility, and heterogeneity, as well as the demand for resource awareness, green computing, and increasing cost pressure. Among technical factors, software development methods, tools, and techniques contribute to dependability and security, as defects in software products and services may lead to failure and also provide typical access for malicious attacks. In addition, there is a wide variety of fault and intrusion tolerance techniques available, including persistence provided by databases, redundancy and replication, group communication, transaction monitors, reliable middleware, cloud infrastructures, light-weight virtualization (docker), fragmentation-redundancy-scattering, and trustworthy service-oriented and microservice architectures with explicit control of the quality of service properties and monitoring of service level agreements. Furthermore, adaptiveness is envisaged in order to react to observed or act upon expected changes of the system itself, the context/environment (e.g., resource variability or failure/threat scenarios), our users needs and expectations. Provided without explicit user intervention, this is also termed autonomous behavior or self-properties, and often involves monitoring, diagnosis (analysis, interpretation), and reconfiguration (repair). In particular, adaptation is also a means to achieve dependability and security in a computing infrastructure with dynamically varying structure and properties and can itself be provided as a service (Control-as-a-service). The track provides a forum for scientists and engineers in academia and industry to present and discuss their latest research findings on selected topics in dependable, adaptive, and trustworthy distributed systems and services.", "date": "2021-03-22T00:00:00", "virtual": false, "live": true, "tags": ["academic", "iot"], "address": null, "country": "South Korea", "region": null, "city": "Gwangju", "latitude": "35.1601475", "longitude": "126.85177764740942"}

Whilst we acknowledge the potential inconvenience of a second date change and the proximity to public holidays in some countries, we believe on balance this will be better for the event participants than the early March dates previously announced. We appreciate your patience in this matter as we believe this is in the best public health interest of our attendees. Building on its recent announcement of the GSX+ online experience on 21-25 September 2020, ASIS is also investing in a robust digital event experience for the European event, including the customary exceptional education, peer to peer knowledge exchange and networking, and a virtual exhibition platform. This will assure a resilient event model so that security professionals who are unable to travel can still participate, and, in the unfortunate case an onsite, in-person event is not feasible, we can seamlessly transition to an engaging online experience for all involved. The event design work is ongoing and the ASIS Europe team will provide updates directly to all registered attendees and exhibitors.

Signal-producing procedures by microscopes, spectrometers, and other sensors have found their way into wide fields of medicine, biotechnology, economy, and environmental analysis. With this arises the problem of the automatic mass analysis of signal information. Signal-interpreting systems that generate automatically the desired target statements from the signals are therefore of compelling necessity. The continuation of mass analyses on the basis of the classical procedures leads to investments of proportions that are not feasible. New procedures and system architectures are therefore required. The scope of the conference is to bring together researchers, practitioners, and industry people who are dealing with mass analysis of images and signals to present and discuss recent research in these fields. The goals of this conference are to: -provide a forum for identifying important contributions and opportunities for research on mass data analysis of signals and images, \n-promote the systematic study of how to apply automatic signal/image analysis and interpretation procedures to that field \n-show case applications of mass data analysis in biology, medicine, and chemistry.", "date": "2021-07-11T00:00:00", "virtual": true, "live": false, "tags": ["artificial_intelligence", "cloud_security"], "address": null, "country": "United States of America", "region": "New York", "city": "New York", "latitude": "40.712742950000006", "longitude": "-74.00595024412516"}
