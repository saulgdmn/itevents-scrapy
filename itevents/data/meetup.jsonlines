We welcome you to a fun learning experience and warm family environment. My name is Masaoki. Im a professional Japanese teacher and I have been holding this event for about 6 years. This event is not like a language school class but aims to be an event where people can learn Japanese through communication with native speakers. (We also welcome native Japanese speaker to join this event.) In this event I divide participants into 3 or 4 different groups according to the level so that you can learn Japanese with people of the same level. ( For beginners, I have easier lessons on Tuesday and Saturday, you can find the events in this meetup group.) I prepare original materials and topics for each group each time so that you can learn something new every time. Moreover, after the lesson part you have the chance to talk freely with other participants including of course Japanese people. This is also a good way to learn every day Japanese. Lets learn Japanese together in a comfortable atmosphere. If you will be better at Japanese your life in Japan will be more fun and enriching!

I've done advanced classes this way, and it's working quite well. *Don't pay until we have eight signups!* You can't RSVP, so leave me a note in the chat to indicate that you are coming. Thanks! Payments can be made through PayPal here on Meetup, and I'll need for at least 8 to sign up to go ahead with the class this Monday. If you have any problems with the system, let me know. If we don't get eight signups by Monday afternoon, we'll try again next week! Thanks, Chris We now have a FB group for Studio Gokko improvisors where we post articles of interest, homework, and chat about the world of improv. Request to join here: Here's where you begin your improv journey! Come and join other beginners and intermediate improvisors on Monday in exploring this most fascinating of art forms. Improv will make you faster on your feet, a better listener, and able to leap tall buildings in a single bound! Our Impro Foundation Program has weekly classes on Mondays and usually one or two monthly 4-hour weekend intensives. Workshops are taught by TCS Director Chris Wells, with other members of the professional Improvazilla Show cast substituting when necessary. ***NOTE- Classes are online via Zoom due to the pandemic.*** Workshops are held at Studio Gokko near Yoyogi-Koen and Hatagaya from 7:30-9:30pm, though we can go over a bit when the spirit of improv and size of the class require it, and cost 2,000. Please bring exact change! And note you can eat in the studio before class but we ask that you take all your trash with you. We work on improv techniques, from the fundamentals of character creation to the complexities of scene work. Youll learn some of the games youve seen on TV or stage and how to play them well and tell great stories at the same time, as well as open scene work that leads to long form improv. Whether you're a beginner or intermediate improvisor, you'll find the classes challenging and fun! Students usually go to a nearby restaurant after the class to chat and get to know one another, so it's educational and social! :) The Improv Foundation Workshops are open workshops, so any native-level English speaker is free to come and give it a try. (Non-native level students are encouraged to come to our new English Through Impro Workshops on Wednesday nights, starting in September, open to anyone who wants to communicate in English and have fun with Improv at the same time.) Diversity Policy We strive to create a welcoming atmosphere for everyone, regardless of minority status. Continued participation is at the discretion of the instructors. So be positive and nice to your fellow improvisors! Also, we're all adults here, but hitting on people isn't cool in a workshop. Just saying. Improvisor Resources Check the Improv Resources page on our website, , for lots of information on terminology, games, and more! And join us on FB: Hope to see you soon at Studio Gokko! Chris Wells, TCS Artistic Director PS: Studio Gokko is about a ten-minute walk from the following stations: Hatsudai, Hatagaya, Yoyogi-koen, and Yoyogi-hachiman. The GPS should take you right there, but just in case, we are very close to a restaurant called Hoff: Were in the basement of an orange-tiled building with a cleaners and glass shop on the first floor, and our door is on the very left-hand side, next to the glass shop, which has  written on its shutter. Look for the Studio Gokko logo on the door!

[Black Zafus are available online under the keywords: Zabuton Futon Cushion for Zen Meditation] >>> If you do not know Zen and Zazen, you might want to email the organizer -[masked]- to receive further information after reading the below explanations: 1-check the following link for the practical aspects: 2-read also those explanations about Zazen: To sit in Zazen is awakening itself. It is the place where our true nature manifests itself. Natural awakening arises when the unity of Body and Mind is revealed. This revelation goes beyond conscious and unconscious. This is why it is said to be the Roar of the Tiger and The Dragon Coming out of the Water. Those words are not mine but those of ancient Masters. Revelation of the unity of Body and Mind naturally, automatically and unconsciously arises during Zazen. This is called Hishiryo or \"natural thinking\" or \"beyond thinking and non-thinking\". \"Beyond thinking and non-thinking\" means the space where thinking and non-thinking appears. \"Natural thinking\" means realization of this space. Hishiryo is the art of Zazen. To realize Bodymind, the body is sitted in a strong and subtle balance. When the body is in balance, the breath becomes quiet and natural. When the breath is harmonized with the body, the mind comes back to stillness. How can we know if our posture is exact? When breathing is deep and quiet. When toughts are calm. Finally, our posture is exact when body, breath and thoughts disappear in a single totality. \"My late Master, the Old Buddha, said, \"Practising Zen is dropping through the bodymind. Just sitting is primordial realization.\" How to sit in Zazen? Sitting on a Zafu crossed legs -Birman, Half-lotus or Lotus- with knees touching the ground. To vertically unroll the back: -push the knees towards the ground, -tune the pelvis angle slightly forward, -set the ears above the shoulders and sotfly stretch the neck, -soflty push the top of the head towards the sky. The plane of the face is vertical, the nose is situated at the same vertical line than the nostril. A good position of the backbone should allow for a deep breathing, which means the free mobility of the belly and of the thoracic cavity. The jaws are relaxed and the tongue is lying horizontally in the mouth touching the upper front teeth. The mouth is closed, air is flowing through the nose silently. Eyes are half closed, the sight is inclined 45. Sight range is more than 180, eyes do not seize anything but are welcoming the image instead. The shoulders are relaxed, lowered down and a bit backwards. The hands are forming the Hokkaijo-in mudra (see practical explanations above). The edge if the hands touch the lower abdomen, two fingers below the nostril. The breathing is the one of the baby: the belly inflates at inhalation, and deflates at exhalation. If thoughts are coming, just notice them without judgement. Sit in Zazen according to all those recommendations, and then forget them all.

Please find below a description of today's event: Translation Club Japan is on Tuesday at 19:30 Japan Time and online! Look forward to seeing you there. We are excited to migrate online and keep connecting through translation. We will be translating Japanese texts into English with people from all over. This is open to anyone interested in learning either language and understanding more about these cultures. Join us with the zoom link mentioned in the location at 19:30, no password required! Before the event: Download zoom so you can fully participate (extra features) Check your camera and microphone is working (we want to connect!) Make sure you have a fairly quiet space (so we can all focus) , ideally a headset or headphones with a microphone on it. Bring an open mind ready to explore new ideas (we will bring the rest) If you have any issues you can reach out to Patrick on [masked]. Look forward to seeing you at 19:30 Japan time. -------------  What we'll do Each session is an opportunity to do group translation, enjoy general social time and reflect on the translation process, i.e. specific vocabulary, sentences which were difficult/insightful, etc. We form groups of 3 people with some native speakers of English, and some native speakers of Japanese. There is a text for us to translate together, we need to use both of the group languages (e.g Japanese and English) to complete the translation. The texts are recent articles about contemporary cultural or social issues. This is one of the few language exchange events in Tokyo that cater to Intermediate to Advanced learners of Japanese and native speakers. We have a core of dedicated language learners who come every week and tackle a different text on a different topic. The workshops are great for English and Japanese learners and speakers who want to develop their knowledge of language and meet other people who speak their language.  Standard agenda for a session: 19:30-19:40: Introduction 19:40-20:45: Group Translation 20:45-21:00: Discussion time, learning sharing.  Important to know 1. This event is entirely free... And in order to keep it this way, we need to be able to calibrate the room for the amount of participants, so please, keep us updated about your participation! 2. If you arrive later than 19:45, please send us a message!

It's a bit of an autumn day, and it's suddenly gone from cool to cold. Last week I had a discussion with you all about the first step to understanding the personalities of others. I heard some stories from some participants that they could not understand their wives, even though they were so close each other. It was a pretty deep topic, and I thought about it a lot afterwards, and I realized one big clue. This time I'd like to approach it from the motivation of why we want to understand another person's mind. Do you want to understand the other person, or do you actually want them to understand you? If you don't start with the right motivation, you won't get an alright result. No age, nationality, gender limitation and this event is for free. Anyone who wants to meet new person, or wants to have free conversation, is welcome too. Please contact me and join in advance so I will send ID and Password for the ZOOM link. Please bring your favorite drinks and snacks to your table if you like, so you can enjoy our event more. For those who only speak English, please contact me in advance so I will try to prepare some arrangement of language. Since the last time we had a fairly international group, we had a 1:1 ratio of English to Japanese.

If you are the type of person who's avoided going to parties and other loud social gatherings even though you were interested in it, this is the right one. You can join us without any hesitation. The participants are very diverse in age, gender, and nationality. What they all have in common is that they come to learn and have an international experience, so this event is suitable for such people who are serious about learning but also want to have a good time. Our venue is exclusively used for the language exchange during the event hours. No specific level is required for any language at \"ENGLISH ONLY CAFE\". With our daily language exchange session, there are thirty minutes sessions alternating between English and Japanese conversation time. So that both language speakers have a chance to learn and teach a language. The conversations are conducted in small groups of three or four people so it is easier to engage in a conversation without being awkward even for beginners of either language. The admission fee is completely free, just pay for your drink on your way in. You can enjoy English conversations and international relationships at the same price as going to an ordinary cafe. This is an international language exchange event with people from over one hundred countries all over the world. It is also a great opportunity to make new friends, so please feel free to come.

Score points for a series of matches over the course of the evening, competing for a share of the prize pool. This week we will be managing the match pairing to create as many 4-player matches and as many new opponents as possible in each round. * This will be complex to arrange, and we ask for your understanding.* Entry Fee: 1 x booster pack towards prize pool Prizes: booster pack prize pool split 1st 3/6, 2nd 2/6, 3rd 1/6* Bonus: participants receive complimentary promo cards from Hareruya * un-awarded prizes are carried over to the following weeks pool If you don't have your own Brawl deck, you are still very welcome to join us, and we always have plenty of decks to share. Join our Discord Online Chat - for daily MTG chat in English and Japanese. Please sign up here if you intend to play. This helps us work more courteously with the Event Team providing our table space, and helps us better organise match start times together, thank you. == Brawl Format == Brawl is a Commander variant, using 60-card decks from the Standard format. Decks are characterised by their Commander - a Legendary or Planeswalker card, and 59 other cards. All cards must follow the Commander's colour-identity and duplicates are allowed, except Basic Land. There is no Commander damage, and infinite combos are not available. Cost: the cost of an effective Brawl deck starts at around $50, and because its a singleton format, its very difficult for costs to exceed about $150, so the notorious pay-to-play aspect of MTG is nicely managed. == Tournament Rules ==  Only 1 deck for all matches in the event  No sideboard and only 1 'Outside the Game card  You may also use a Companion card with your Commander  you must declare OTG and Companion cards before matches start  4 player matches will be preferred (then 3 player, and finally 2 player)  If 2 player matches are required, they are played as Best of Three  Matches are all 60 minutes plus 1 full turn for each remaining player  Players may join the tournament after its begun  At 22:45, any remaining matches will be stopped and scored  Prize giving will follow the tournaments conclusion == Covid-19 Precautions == Please comply with the following, thank you  do not attend if you feel in the least bit unwell in any way  disinfect your hands upon entering the building  wear a surgical mask for the duration of our games == Scoring formula == We use a modified DCI scoring system that weve devised for our November Grand Brawl event. It is intended to discourage individual attacks and reward the most ambitious victory in which all other players are defeated. Match pairing prefers unique 4-player matches, but note this is more difficult in smaller groups. Points are awarded for each match played, and the winners are the players with the highest total scores. Score 3 points for a win; 0 points for a loss. 1 point each for a tie. Win means to have defeated all opponents Lose means to be eliminated before the match ends Tie means to be still alive when the match ends The scoring possibilities are these: For 4 player: (3,0,0,0) (1,1,1,1) (1,1,1,0) (1,1,0,0) For 3 players: (3,0,0) (1,1,1) (1,1,0) For 2 players: (3,0) (1,1)", "date": "2020-10-21T00:00:00", "virtual": null, "live": true, "tags": [], "city": null, "region": null, "country": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}

This time we have the pleasure of hosting Colin Singh Dhillon and AJ Khan. PRESENTATION: Hundreds and millions of lines of code in new vehicles, their environment and in general, the complete ecosystem we live and work in. Data is being shared through the cloud or by edge computing, making our machines more intelligent and able to function with artificial intelligence, but are they more vulnerable and susceptible to cyber-attacks? As we facilitate the era of Digital Manufacturing and embrace the V2X ideology, now more than ever, do we need to make sure that our complete supply chain is secure? ABOUT THE PRESENTERS: Colin Singh Dhillon Chief Technical Officer at Canadas Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association Colin Singh Dhillon is the Chief Technical Officer at Canadas Automotive Parts Manufacturers Association, and a globally recognized Thought Leader and Innovator. He leads connected and autonomous vehicle technology projects. He provides support to both the Canadian automotive industry and multiple levels of Government on matters of the digitization of automobiles, manufacturing, and smart cities. With over twenty years of experience in the automotive industry, Colin has lead Design Studios, Marketing & Communication, Corporate Social Responsibility, and global Advanced Product Development (R&D) teams for one of Canadas major Tier 1s. In addition to his position as CTO, Colin has chaired a Canadian Museum, written and produced a documentary film, and was a professor of design and innovation.

AJ is an ardent advocate of Cyber Security and Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC). In his view, there is a critical need to address Cyber Security in todays Connected and Cloud deployments and if considerable effort is not made to address this issue, corporations will incorporate considerable Security Debt that will manifest itself later in the form of major security breaches. This will not only lead to loss of critical data and disruptions in operations activity, it will also lead to a major loss in the brand equity and reputation. Hence, Governance, Risk & Compliance is imperative for todays technology and business strategies.", "date": "2020-10-23T00:00:00", "virtual": null, "live": true, "tags": [], "city": null, "region": null, "country": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}

It is a pervasive disability and has brought a lot of difficulties to peoples daily life. Unlike people who are blind, low vision people have residual vision and extensively use their vision in daily activities. However, prior research has mainly focused on providing only audio and tactile feedback for blind users, overlooking low vision peoples residual vision and unique needs. To address this gap in low vision accessibility, I seek to leverage the residual vision that low vision people have, and design intelligent augmented reality (AR) systems that provide direct visual augmentations according to the users' visual abilities and tasks. In this talk, I will discuss how I design tailored visual augmentations and build AR systems to assist low vision people in different daily tasks, such as the visual search and stair navigation tasks. For example, I built a head-mounted AR system that presented visual cues to orient users attention in a visual search task, as well as a projection-based AR system that projected visual highlights on the stair edges to support safe stair navigation. I will conclude my talk by highlighting my future research directions, such as building AR systems for multi-user scenarios (e.g., social interaction) and diverse disabilities (e.g., autism). Presenter Bio: Yuhang Zhao is a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell Tech, and will be joining the CS department at the University of Wisconsin-Madison as an assistant professor in January 2021. Her research interests lie in human-computer interaction (HCI), accessibility, and augmented and virtual reality. She designs and builds intelligent interactive systems to enhance human abilities. She has published at many top-tier conferences and journals in the field of HCI (e.g., CHI, UIST, ASSETS), and has received 3 U.S. and international patents.

Our meetings are open to all. Guests don't pay a fee.

There are approx. 4,000 members and 198 active clubs in Japan. This club was originally launched in October 2007. Pioneer TMC is a bilingual club (JP/EN) with members from various cultural background, suitable for both foreigners living in Japan and Japanese. What happens on this day? We are going to have Table Topics Session (impromptu speech), prepared speeches followed by individual evaluations. 7-8pm will be in English, 8-9pm will be in Japanese.

These unprecedented times have changed the way people operate in so many areas of life, some of them are social interaction, public speaking and communication. What can be more luxurious and comfortable than sitting at home, sipping a nice tea or coffee, interacting with great minds from different areas of life, learning each day a different communication skill while improving confidence to become a better leader and communicator.  Welcome to your opportunity to conquer the fear of public speaking and gain confidence in a supportive environment! At each session we will cover a different aspect of Public Speaking.

If you own a brick-and-mortar store, collecting sales tax is an ordinary course of doing business. Customers pay the sales tax required in your jurisdiction, and you submit payments to the government as necessary. However, if you begin selling the same products online  to foreign customers  what are the tax rules? Are customers charged the same rate online that they would pay in person?

ABOUT GO JAKARTA: GoJakarta is a monthly meetup group focused on examining applications, frameworks, and technologies written in the Go programming language. The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.", "date": "2020-10-27T00:00:00", "virtual": null, "live": true, "tags": [], "city": null, "region": null, "country": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}

Because of how hard it's been for us all to be isolated, I've decided to set up this Online Cafe, a 2 hour Zoom meeting that will take place every Thursday afternoon from 11:00 am to 1:00 pm. Meeting link: This is a free, recurring meeting that we can show up to without leaving our homes. The idea is that we come together to quietly work on our own thing (whether that's working on your job, creative projects, emails and admin, being alone in a crowd, whatever does it for you). You can choose to have your video on or off, but all microphones will be turned off so that everyone can control their own sound experience, whether that means they work in silence or choose their own music/background sounds. And you can bring your own food and drink of course :) For those among us who would like to be a bit social, the chat feature will be open for people to exchange text msgs, whether with the whole group or privately with other individuals (but please be respectful, no creepiness and no sales/proselytising - instant ban for anyone being disrespectful). If anyone would like to break out into a separate chat where you can have mics on without disturbing the main meeting, feel free to let me know through the chat feature and I'll be happy to set it up for you. I've set up this Online Cafe as a recurring meeting for the next few months (until mid-December). I know it's not the same as (or even close to) a real cafe, but hopefully we can at least replicate the feeling of being around other people without having to engage much :) I will of course be present at every meeting. I will also be happy to chat with anyone who wants to know more about the theatre workshops and creative mentoring programs I run ( ).

GET TICKETS FOR THIS EVENT HERE: All times are California time, GMT -7 (**You will not receive the webinar link if you only register on MeetUp.)

To give back to the startup community, the first installment of the 3-part series is free of charge. Parts two and three will have a small fees to attend AND, there is a discount available if you purchase the full trilogy now. CURRICULUM Besides building and selling a product, entrepreneurs need to worry about many other things: - How to form a company - How to hire the right people - How to compensate the team - How to split the pie with the cofounders and the team members - How much equity to give investors and at what valuation - How to raise money and under what terms - And many more Often times these issues seem overwhelming, and traps for the unwary or uninformed are numerous. However, successfully avoiding the most common pitfalls can make a significant difference: - as to whether or not your startup is fundable - the sources and types of capital that you will attract - who controls the company - how much you will make upon exit - and your startups overall likelihood of success. In this first segment of the Startup Fundamentals series, Roger Rappoport, will conduct an interactive, informative session with great take away materials and actionable items. Startup issues that will be covered in this workshop (among others): choices in entity selection; creating an appropriate capitalization table; co-founders vs early employees (should they be treated differently?) appropriate allocations of founders stock (including Series FF Preferred Stock) between founders and vesting, repurchase rights and rights of first refusal determining if and when it is appropriate to obtain proxies from co-founders/early employees stock allocation for employees, consultants, board and advisory board members, and the perils of Section 409A under the Internal Revenue Code when granting options when milestone based vesting, as opposed to time based vesting, is appropriate the assignment of intellectual property, and ensuring that all IP created belongs to the company executing employment/consulting agreements and the value of developing an intellectual property strategy early on.

It is an hour long process with 5 stages involving intense breathing, catharsis, mantra chanting, silence and finally celebrating. The process first awakens your inner energies through breathing and then takes you into a process of deep mind-heart cleansing through catharsis to make you like an empty vessel, capable of reverberating the mantra \"hoo\" inside, so intensely that your kundalini energy, the sleeping energy awakens and rises to higher neural centers. This brings silence and bliss together and a feeling of connectedness with everything around.

It is an hour long process with 5 stages involving intense breathing, catharsis, mantra chanting, silence and finally celebrating. The process first awakens your inner energies through breathing and then takes you into a process of deep mind-heart cleansing through catharsis to make you like an empty vessel, capable of reverberating the mantra \"hoo\" inside, so intensely that your kundalini energy, the sleeping energy awakens and rises to higher neural centers. This brings silence and bliss together and a feeling of connectedness with everything around.

We saw a need for our customers to create highly connected data and derive insight by using graph technology. Originally released in 2018, RedisGraph is the result of that effort. RedisGraph is based on a unique approach and architecture that translates the Cypher query language to matrix operations executed over a GraphBLAS-based engine. By using sparse matrices to represent graphs and the power of GraphBLAS to process them, RedisGraph delivers a fast and efficient way to manage and process graph data shown to have significant advantages over other approaches in some applications.

And the most important relationship is our intimate space where we are vulnerable, open and unguarded. No judgments on the physical act, no moral rules put here you may be whoever whatever wherever and with whoever When emotionally overwhelmed, people tend to regress and revert to Childhood strategies to get their needs met. When the mind is overloaded, it is natural to look for immediate gratification. It's at those times that the id or inner child might wreak havoc on your relationships, or even your life. For a different phase of life we need different and more evolved strategies. But People who are Chronically overloaded with stress, life transitions, medical conditions, or chronic relationship conflict may rely on childhood strategies to get their needs met. Intimacy could be widely described in four forms  Experiential Intimacy : Ex : A father and son work together to build a model train, developing a rhythm to their teamwork.  Emotional Intimacy : Ex: A woman confides in her sister about her body image issues. She trusts her sibling to offer comfort rather than using her insecurities against her.  Intellectual Intimacy : Ex : Two friends debate the meaning of life. They enjoy hearing each others opinions and dont feel the need to win the argument.  Sexual Intimacy : Ex : Two lovers engage in foreplay, knowing how each other prefers to be touched. We will be looking at Sexual Intimacy and Emotional Intimacy . FEAR OF INTIMACY Intimacy can be the biggest gift or the worst curse you can experience in life . It can help you feel more loved and less alone. But intimacy also requires a great deal of trust and vulnerability, and you may find this frightening. Many people struggle with intimacy, and fear of intimacy is a common concern in therapy. People can fear intimacy due to a variety of reasons. Some of the most common causes include:  Abandonment Issues : You may fear that once you become attached to someone, that individual will leave. Fear of Rejection : You might worry that once you reveal any flaws or imperfections, the other person will no longer want to be with you.  Control Issues : You may fear losing your independence as you become emotionally connected to others.  Past Abuse : A history of childhood abuse, especially sexual abuse, may make it difficult for you to trust others. Over a period of 4 weeks , we would together explore the unconscious reasons beliefs and patterns that keep us stuck and find a release into wholeness and consciously create newer healthier , and empowering patterns . We will be doing core clearing work ,where in a safe group setting we might regress into our childhood memories , seize the old disempowering meanings and clear the charge out of is so that we can install newer empowering ones . 2 hrs. engagement/ every Saturday.  Learn to deeply be grounded in the body  Invoke elements of Safety and Security  Open up internal dialogues between conscious-unconscious parts of us Access the wounded aspects / Old disempowering stories  Heal and Reclaim our Core Inner power Rescript newer and empowering stories  Sharing and Closure PS : This is a space space for emotional work, confidentiality will be maintained.

Creating plugins is not very difficult, but getting started can be a bit painful. In this talk, the speaker will show you how you can get started very easily using a Docker image (see ). Well see how to write a Ruby plugin as well as the new pure-Java plugins, including unit and performance testing. As examples the speaker will show logstash-filter-dnssummary ( ) for summarising FQDNs to the level of the site, and more excitingly logstash-filter-mmdb ( ) which lets you enrich your IP addresses into their subnets/VLANs or whatever you like using a custom MMDB, based on the data in your IP Address Management solution.

However, with its ever-increasing magnitude and throughput, analysing this unstructured data has become a tedious task. This has led to the rise of Natural Language Processing (NLP), as the go-to for examining and processing large amounts of natural language data. This involves the automatic extraction of structured semantic information from unstructured machine-readable text. The identification of these explicit concepts and relationships help in discovering multiple insights contained in text in a scalable and effective way. A major challenge is the mapping of unstructured information from raw texts into entities, relationships and attributes in the knowledge graph. In this talk, we demonstrate how Grakn can be used to create a text mining knowledge graph capable of modelling, storing, and exploring beneficial information extracted from medical literature.", "date": "2020-11-04T00:00:00", "virtual": null, "live": true, "tags": [], "city": null, "region": null, "country": null, "latitude": null, "longitude": null}

More and more voice-controlled devices such as the Apple HomePod, Alexa, Google Home, and Amazon Echo are storming the market. Voice user interfaces are helping to improve user experiences. With Voice User Interfaces(VUIs), voice interactions are becoming more common in todays technology.

As a declarative language, its straightforward to write queries and build powerful applications. However, relational databases struggle when working with complex data. When querying such data in SQL, challenges especially arise in the modelling and querying of the data. For example, due to the large number of necessary JOINs, it forces us to write long and verbose queries. Such queries are difficult to write and prone to mistakes. Graql is the query language used in Grakn. Just as SQL is the standard query language in relational databases, Graql is Grakns query language. Its a declarative language, and allows us to model, query and reason over our data. In this talk, we will look at how Graql compares to SQL. Why and when should you use Graql over SQL?

Santa Monica, California One of his most famous comics on Microservice TOPIC - What Do We Do When Everything is Automated? As automation continues to permeate the fabric of the society -- technologically, economically, and culturally -- there's a good argument to be made that at some point in the near future wage-earning work will disappear for most. According to a 2017 study from the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University in Indiana, \"Almost 88% of job losses in manufacturing in recent years can be attributable to productivity growth, and the long-term changes to manufacturing employment are mostly linked to the productivity of American factories.\" The prospect is very real. In this presentation, Bob Reselman, internationally known developer, technical writer, journalist, and author of the recently published book, The Impact of Automation, talks about issues that automation presents in the near and long term as well as ways to address the challenges ahead.
